<h2><a id="THE_SHOEMAKER_AND_THE_ELVES"></a>THE SHOEMAKER AND THE ELVES</h2>


<p>There was once an honest shoemaker who worked very
hard at his trade; yet through no fault of his own he grew
poorer and poorer. At last he had only just enough leather
left to make one pair of shoes. In the evening he cut out
the leather so as to be ready to make the shoes the next day.</p>

<p>He rose early in the morning, and went to his bench.
But what did he see? There stood the pair of shoes,
already made. The poor man could hardly believe his
eyes, and he did not know what to think. He took the
shoes in his hand to look at them closely. Every stitch
was in its right place. A finer piece of work was never
seen.</p>

<p>Very soon a customer came, and the shoes pleased him
so well that he willingly paid a higher price than usual for
them. The shoemaker now had enough money to buy
leather for two pairs of shoes. In the evening he cut them
out with great care, and went to bed early so that he might
be up in good time the next day. But he was saved all
trouble; for when he rose in the morning, two pairs of well-made
shoes stood in a row upon his bench.</p>

<p>Presently in came customers, who paid him a high price
for the shoes, and with the money that he received, he
bought enough leather to make four pairs of shoes. Again
he cut the work out overnight and again he found it finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
in the morning. The shoemaker’s good fortune continued.
All the shoes he cut out in the day were finished at night.
The good man rose early, and he was busy every moment
of the day. Every pair found ready sale. “Never did
shoes wear so long,”
said the buyers.</p>
<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/p011.jpg" alt="Shoemaker keeping watch" />
</div>

<p>One evening, about
Christmas time, the
shoemaker said to his
wife, “Let us watch to-night
and see who it is
that does this work for
us.” So they left a
light burning and hid
themselves behind a
curtain which hung
in the corner of the
room. As soon as it
was midnight there came two little dwarfs. They sat
down upon the shoemaker’s bench, and began to work with
their tiny fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away.
Never had the good shoemaker and his wife seen such rapid
work. The elves did not stop till the task was quite finished,
and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.
This was long before daybreak, and then they bustled away
as quick as lightning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>The next day the shoemaker’s wife said to her husband:
“These little folks have made us rich, and we ought to be
thankful to them and do them a service in return. They
must be cold, for they have nothing on their backs to keep
them warm. I shall make each of them a suit of clothes,
and you shall make some shoes for them.”</p>

<p>This the shoemaker was very glad to do. When the
little suits and the new shoes were finished, they were laid
on the bench instead of the usual work. Again the good
people hid themselves in the corner of the room to watch.
About midnight the elves appeared. When they found
the neat little garments waiting for them, they showed the
greatest delight. They dressed in a moment, and jumped
and capered and sprang about until they danced out of the
door and over the green.</p>

<p>Never were they seen again, but everything went well
with the shoemaker and his wife from that time forward
as long as they lived.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jacob Grimm.</span></p>

<h2><a id="FORTUNE_AND_THE_BEGGAR"></a>FORTUNE AND THE BEGGAR</h2>


<p>One day a ragged beggar was creeping along from house
to house. He carried an old wallet in his hand, and was
asking at every door for a few cents to buy something to eat.
As he was grumbling at his lot, he kept wondering why it
was that people who had so much money were never satisfied,
but were always wanting more.</p>

<p>“Here,” said he, “is the master of this house&mdash;I know
him well. He was always a good business man, and he
made himself wondrously rich a long time ago. Had he
been wise he would have stopped then. He would have
turned over his business to some one else, and then he
could have spent the rest of his life in ease. But what did
he do instead? He began building ships and sending them
to sea to trade with foreign lands. He thought he would
get mountains of gold.</p>

<p>“But there were great storms on the water; his ships
were wrecked, and his riches were swallowed up by the
waves. Now his hopes all lie at the bottom of the sea,
and his great wealth has vanished like the dreams of a night.
There are many such cases. Men seem never to be satisfied
unless they can gain the whole world. As for me, if I had
only enough to eat and to wear I would not wish anything
more.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment Fortune came down the street.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
She saw the beggar and stopped. She said to him: “Listen!
I have long desired to help you. Hold your wallet and I
shall pour this gold into it. But I shall pour only on this
condition: All that falls into the wallet shall be pure gold,
but every piece that falls upon the ground shall become dust.
Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I understand,” said the beggar.</p>
<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p016.jpg" alt="Beggar, Fortune and horn" />
</div>


<p>“Then have a care,” said Fortune. “Your wallet is old;
so do not load it too heavily.”</p>

<p>The beggar was so glad that he could hardly wait. He
quickly opened his wallet, and a stream of yellow dollars
was poured into it. The wallet soon began to grow heavy.</p>

<p>“Is that enough?” asked Fortune.</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it cracking?”</p>

<p>“Never fear.”</p>

<p>The beggar’s hands began to tremble. Ah, if the golden
stream would only pour forever!</p>

<p>“You are the richest man in the world now!”</p>

<p>“Just a little more,” said the beggar; “add just a handful
or two.”</p>

<p>“There, it’s full. The wallet will burst.”</p>

<p>“But it will hold a little more, just a little more!”</p>

<p>Another piece was added and the wallet split. The
treasure fell upon the ground and was turned to dust. Fortune
had vanished.</p>

<p>The beggar had now nothing but his empty wallet, and
it was torn from top to bottom. He was as poor as before.</p>

<h2><a id="A_CRUST_OF_BREAD"></a>A CRUST OF BREAD</h2>


<p>The boy was lying under a big shady tree eating a large
crust of bread. He had been romping with his dog in the
garden, enjoying the sweet flowers and the bright sunshine.
Now he rested in the cool shade of the apple-tree with the
dog curled up at his feet. The birds were warbling their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
gayest songs in the topmost branches, and the leaves cast
their dancing shadows on the soft carpet of green below.</p>

<p>As the dog was fast asleep, the boy had no one with whom
to play. Just then a lady, beautifully dressed and holding
a wand in her hand, stood before him. She smiled, and then
placed her wand on the crust of bread, after which she
at once vanished. She had no sooner gone than the boy
rubbed his eyes in wonder, for the crust of bread was
talking in a gentle voice.</p>

<p>“Would you like to hear my story?” it said. The boy
nodded his head, as if to say yes, and the crust began:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Once upon a time I was a little baby seed. I lived in a
large home called a granary. In this home were many other
baby seeds just like me. No one could tell one from the
other, as we all belonged to the same family and looked so
much alike. We lived there very quietly until one day
my sister cried, ‘Hark! do you hear that noise? The mice
are coming!’ Then she told us the mice were fond of little
grains of wheat, and that if they were to eat us we would
never grow to be like our mother. We heard them many
times after that, but we never saw them.</p>

<p>“One day a farmer came and put us into a large sack.
It was so dark in the sack, and we lay so very near together
that I thought we should smother. Soon I felt myself
sliding. I tried to cling to the sack, but the other grains
in their rush to the sunlight took me along with them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
In our wild race we ran into a tube, and, going faster and
faster, we soon fell into the seed-drill.</p>

<p>“Then I felt myself sliding again, for the seed-drill was
moving forward. I could hear the driver call out in loud
tones to the horses, ‘Get up!’ and round and round went the
big wheels of the drill. All at once I went under cover in
the rich ground. At first I did not like to be shut in from
the sunlight. But one day when I heard the crows, I was
glad that I was under the coverlet of the ground. I heard
their cry of ‘Caw, caw,’ and how frightened I was! I
knew that the crows were near, and that they liked the little
baby wheat grains. This made me thank the farmer and
Mother Nature for giving me such a good home. The crows
could not find me, and by and by they flew away.</p>

<p>“Mother Nature now warmed me, and the rains fed me.
I went to sleep, but one bright morning I awoke. The rain
had been tapping on our great brown house, telling us to
awake from our nap. I had grown so large while sleeping
that my brown coat burst open. The sun had warmed my
bed. I put a little white rootlet out and sent it down into
the ground. The gentle spring breeze and the warm days
brought my first blade into the sunlight above the ground,
and peeping out I was glad to see everything growing fresh
and green. I could see the tender sprouting grass and the
opening buds. I could hear the bluebird’s song and the
robin’s warble. I could smell the balmy air of spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>“Mother Nature sent her children every day to help me.
The rain came through the soil, and brought me food and
drink. The sun fairies warmed my sprouting leaves, and
the wind brought me fresh air. In June I wore a dainty
green dress of slender, graceful leaves. As my sisters and I
stood in the great field on the plain, and were wafted to and
fro by the winds, we looked like the waves of the rolling deep.</p>

<p>“So I grew and grew, and one morning after the dew had
given me my cool bath, and the sun fairies had dried my
leaves, the south wind whispered her song to me, and I
found myself a full-grown plant. I was proud of my spikelets
of flowers, and now could wave with my sisters in
the rolling seas of wheat. Down at the base of our little
spikelets were seed cups in which slept the little baby seeds.
The wind rocked them to sleep, and, sleeping, they grew to
the full-sized wheat grain.</p>

<p>“By and by we became tall stalks of golden wheat, and
the farmer was glad to look at us. When we were fully
ripe, the great reaping-machine drawn by a number of horses
came along and cut us down. Then we were picked up and
sent whirling through the buzzing jaws of the thrasher. Our
grains of wheat were screened from the chaff and straw,
and fell into sacks. Then we were put on trains and
transported to the mammoth granaries to be stored away
until the flour-mills wanted us.</p>

<p>“At last we reached the mills. There we were turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
into beautiful white flour and shipped to the market.
So in time we, as flour, reached the housewife’s or baker’s
well-stocked kitchen, where we were put into trays, and,
being mixed with a little salt, yeast, and some water, were
kneaded into loaves of bread and baked. This is the story
of my life from a little grain of wheat until I became the
crust of bread that you are eating.”</p>

<p>The sun was sinking in the west, the birds were winging
their flight homewards, and night was fast coming on. The
dog yawned, and, stretching himself out, was ready for
another romp with his master. The boy awoke from his
dream and hurried home to help with the evening meal,
and to do his share of the world’s work.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_RICH_MAN_AND_THE_COBBLER"></a>THE RICH MAN AND THE COBBLER</h2>


<p>In old Paris, very rich people and quite poor people
used to live close by each other. Up one stair might be
found a very rich man; up two stairs a man not quite so
rich; up three stairs a man who had not very much money.
On the very lowest floor, a little below the street, were to
be found the poorest folks of all. It was on this low floor
that a cobbler used to live and mend shoes and sing songs.
For he was a very happy cobbler, and went on singing all
day, and keeping time with his hammer or his needle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p026.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Rich Man and his Friend</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>Up one stair, or on what is called the first floor, lived a very
rich man, so rich that he did not know how rich he was&mdash;so
rich that he could not sleep at nights for trying to find
out how much money he had, and if it were quite
safe.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that it is easier to sleep in the morning
than at night. So nobody will wonder when I say that
this rich man lay awake all night and always fell asleep in
the morning. But no sooner did he fall asleep than he was
wakened again. It was not his money that wakened him
this time&mdash;it was the cobbler. Every morning, just as the
rich man fell asleep the cobbler awoke, and in almost no
time was sitting at his door, sewing away and singing like
a lark.</p>

<p>The rich man went to a friend and said, ”I can’t sleep
at night for thinking of my money, and I can’t sleep in the
morning for listening to that cobbler’s singing. What am I
to do?” This friend was a wise man, and told him of a plan.</p>

<p>Next forenoon, while the cobbler was singing away as
usual, the rich man came down the four steps that led
from the pavement to the cobbler’s door.</p>

<p>“Now here’s a fine job,” thought the happy cobbler.
“He’s going to get me to make a grand pair of boots, and
won’t he pay me well!”</p>

<p>But the rich man did not want boots or anything. He
had come to give, not to get. In his hand he had a leather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
bag filled with something that jingled. “Here, cobbler,”
said the rich man, “I have brought you a present of a hundred
crowns.”</p>

<p>“A hundred crowns!” cried the cobbler; “but I’ve
done nothing. Why do you give me this money?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s because you’re always so happy.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll never ask it back?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Nor bring lawyers about it and put me in prison?”</p>

<p>“No, no. Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll take the money, and I thank you very,
very much.”</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/p028.jpg" alt="Cobbler sitting at a table" />
</div>

<p>When the rich man had gone the cobbler opened the
bag, and was just about to pour out the money into his
leather apron to count
how much it was, when
he saw a man in the
street looking at him.
This would never do, so
he went into the darkest
part of his house and
counted the hundred
crowns. He had never
seen so much money in his life before, but somehow he did
not feel so happy as he felt he should.</p>


<p>Just then his wife came in quietly, and gave the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
cobbler such a fright that he lost his temper and scolded
her, a thing he had never done in his life.</p>

<p>Next he hid the bag below the pillow of the bed, because
he could see that place from the door where he worked.
But by and by he began to think that if he could see it
from the door so could other people. So he went in and
changed the bag to the bottom of the bed. Two or three
times every hour he went in to see that the bag was all
right. His wife wanted to know what was the matter with
the bed, but he told her to mind her own business. The
next time she was not looking he slipped the bag into the
bottom of an old box, and from that time he kept changing
it about from place to place whenever he got a chance. If
he had told his wife it would not have been so bad, but he
was afraid even of her.</p>

<p>Next morning the rich man fell asleep as usual, and was
not disturbed by the cobbler’s song. The next morning
was the same, and the next, and the next. Everybody
noticed what a change had come over the cobbler. He no
longer sang. He did little work, for he was always running
out and in to see if his money was all right; and he was
very unhappy.</p>

<p>On the sixth day he made up his mind what to do. I
think he talked it over with his wife at last, but I am not
sure. Anyway, he went up his four steps, and then up the
one stair that led to the rich man’s room. When he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
entered, he went up to the table and laid down the bag,
and said, “Sir, here are your hundred crowns; give me
back my song.”</p>

<p>Next morning things were as bad as ever for the poor
rich man, who had to remove, they say, to another part
of Paris where the cobblers are not so happy.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_GOLDEN_WINDOWS"></a>THE GOLDEN WINDOWS</h2>


<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p032.jpg" alt="Boy walking and seeing golden widows in distance" />
</div>

<p>All day long the little boy
worked hard, in field and barn
and shed, for his people were
poor farmers, and could not pay
a workman; but at sunset there
came an hour that was all his
own, for his father had given it
to him. Then the boy would go up to the top of a hill
and look across at another hill that rose some miles
away. On this far hill stood a house with windows of
clear gold and diamonds. They shone and blazed so that
it made the boy wink to look at them; but after a
while the people in the house put up shutters, as it
seemed, and then it looked like any common farm-house.
The boy supposed they did this because it was supper-time;
and then he would go into the house and have his
supper of bread and milk and so to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>One day the boy’s father called him and said: “You
have been a good boy, and have earned a holiday. Take
this day for your own; but remember that God gave it,
and try to learn some good thing.”</p>

<p>The boy thanked his father and kissed his mother; then
he put a piece of bread in his pocket, and set out to find the
house with the golden windows.</p>

<p>It was pleasant walking. His bare feet made marks in
the white dust, and when he looked back, the footprints
seemed to be following him, and making company for him.
His shadow, too, kept beside him, and would dance or run
with him as he pleased; so it was very cheerful. By and
by he felt hungry; and he sat down by a brown brook that
ran through the alder hedge by the roadside, and ate his
bread, and drank the clear water. Then he scattered the
crumbs for the birds, as his mother had taught him to do,
and went on his way.</p>

<p>After a long time he came to a high green hill; and when
he had climbed the hill, there was the house on the top; but
it seemed that the shutters were up, for he could not see
the golden windows. He came up to the house, and then
he could well have wept, for the windows were of clear glass,
like any others, and there was no gold anywhere about
them.</p>

<p>A woman came to the door, and looked kindly at the
boy, and asked him what he wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>“I saw the golden windows from our hilltop,” he said,
“and I came to see them, but now they are only
glass.”</p>

<p>The woman shook her head and laughed.</p>

<p>“We are poor farming people,” she said, “and are not
likely to have gold about our windows; but glass is better
to see through.”</p>

<p>She told the boy to sit down on the broad stone step at
the door, and brought him a cup of milk and a cake, and
bade him rest; then she called her daughter, a child of his
own age, and nodded kindly at the two, and went back to
her work.</p>

<p>The little girl was barefooted like himself, and wore a
brown cotton gown, but her hair was golden like the windows
he had seen, and her eyes were blue like the sky at
noon. She led the boy about the farm, and showed him her
black calf with the white star on its forehead, and he told
her about his own at home, which was red like a chestnut,
with four white feet. Then when they had eaten an apple
together, and so had become friends, the boy asked her
about the golden windows. The little girl nodded, and said
she knew all about them, only he had mistaken the house.</p>

<p>“You have come quite the wrong way!” she said. “Come
with me, and I shall show you the house with the golden
windows, and then you will see for yourself.”</p>

<p>They went to a knoll that rose behind the farm-house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
and as they went the little girl told him that the
golden windows could be seen only at a certain hour,
about sunset.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that!” said the boy.</p>

<p>When they reached the top of the knoll, the girl turned
and pointed; and there on a hill far away stood a house
with windows of clear gold and diamond, just as he had seen
them. And when they looked again, the boy saw that it
was his own home.</p>

<p>Then he told the little girl that he must go. He promised
to come again, but he did not tell her what he had learned;
and so he went back down the hill, and the little girl stood
in the sunset light and watched him.</p>

<p>The way home was long, and it was dark before the boy
reached his father’s house; but the lamplight and firelight
shone through the windows, making them almost as bright
as he had seen them from the hilltop; and when he opened
the door, his mother came to kiss him, and his little sister
ran to throw her arms about his neck, and his father looked
up and smiled from his seat by the fire.</p>

<p>“Have you had a good day?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>Yes, the boy had had a very good day.</p>

<p>“And have you learned anything?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the boy. “I have learned that our house
has windows of gold and diamond.”</p>

<h2><a id="A_MISERS_TREASURE"></a>A MISER’S TREASURE</h2>


<p>There once lived, in a little English town, a skilful linen
weaver named Silas Marner. He was of a simple, trusting
nature. He thought no wrong of anybody, and had never
harmed any one in word or deed. Among his friends in the
town there was one man whom he loved so dearly that he
would gladly have given his life for him.</p>

<p>This man, however, far from being a true friend, acted
most dishonestly and unfaithfully. Having committed a
robbery himself, he cast the blame on Silas; and the weaver,
who was too simple to see through the trick that had been
played upon him, was forced to leave his native town, not
only a disgraced, but a broken-hearted, man. The wickedness
of the man whom he had thought his true friend, and
the readiness of all his fellow-townsmen to believe evil of
him, changed his whole nature and made him suspicious
of and bitter against all men.</p>

<p>He wandered forth and settled at last in the village of
Raveloe, far away from his old home. There he took up his
abode in a little weather-beaten cottage at the outskirts of
the town, and would have nothing to do with his neighbors
beyond furnishing them with the fine linen he wove so well,
and taking his pay in gold.</p>

<p>All day long he sat spinning at his loom, seeing no one
and thinking only of his wrongs; and at night he had noth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>ing
to do but count his gold and watch with delight how the
pile grew larger and larger every week. At last the gold,
taking the place of his former interests, became the one
thing in life he cared for. He hoarded it and gloated over it
like a miser; and before long, though he still worked steadily
at his loom, he thought no more of his work, but only of the
gold it would bring him to add to his store. Thus passed
his life for a long time.</p>

<p>But one evening when Silas had gone out to carry a bundle
to a neighboring house, and had left his door ajar because
he meant to be back in a short time, a thief, attracted by
the light and the open door, entered the weaver’s hut and
stole the bags of gold. When he returned, and, as usual,
lifted the stone under which his treasure was hidden, he
found nothing but the empty hole.</p>

<p>At first he could not believe that the money was gone.
He hunted everywhere through his little cottage, turning
again and again to the empty hole in the ground, to make
sure that his eyes had not deceived him. When at last the
truth forced itself upon him that his gold was really gone, he
uttered a cry of anger and dismay, and rushed forth into the
night, weeping and wailing and searching in vain for his lost
treasure.</p>

<p>His neighbors, who soon heard what had happened, felt
very sorry for him, and tried to show, by many little kind
acts, their friendliness for the now desolate man. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
would have nothing to do with any of them. He shut himself
up in his cheerless cottage, and though, from force of
habit, he still worked at his loom, he had no longer any
interest in life.</p>

<p>One bitterly cold night, Silas again had occasion to go out
after dark. This time he left his door wide open, for now he
had nothing left to lose. But while he was gone, a little
golden-haired child, whose poor mother lay frozen to death
in the snow on the roadside, had spied the light in Marner’s
cottage and had crept to it for safety. Once inside the
warm room, the child had fallen asleep, her golden head
resting upon the very spot from which the miser’s treasure
had been stolen.</p>

<p>When Silas entered the cottage and saw the glitter of gold
on the floor, he was so startled that for a moment he stood
stock-still. His first thought was that his treasure had been
restored to him, and with a cry of joy he rushed forward to
seize it. But instead of the cold, hard gold, he felt soft,
warm curls; and the next minute the little child, who was
awakened by his touch, began to cry.</p>

<p>Silas Marner, dazed as he was by the strange, living thing
he had found in the place of his lost gold, did all he could
to comfort the frightened little stranger; and soon, warm
and no longer hungry, she was nestling her golden head
against his arm, and laughing and babbling as contentedly
as though she had always known her protector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>That was the beginning of a new happiness for Silas, much
more satisfying than the miser’s love he had formerly felt
for his gold. The lonely, helpless child aroused his pity and
affection. As the mother was dead and no relatives came to
claim the little girl, he decided to take care of her himself,
and soon found himself loving her with a deep, fatherly
tenderness.</p>

<p>He knew so little about children, however, that he needed
the advice of a woman to help him bring up Eppie, as he
had called the little girl; and so, gradually, he began to
mingle more and more with the people of the village. As
for the simple Raveloe folk, when they saw Silas Marner’s
tenderness for the child, they felt that they had not really
understood the lonely man. Before long all the villagers
were on the best of terms with Silas and Eppie, and he had
cast behind him all the hatred and bitterness that had led
him to shun his fellow-men.</p>

<p>Eppie grew up strong and beautiful, and by the most
tender love repaid Silas Marner for all his care of her through
the years of her childhood. She had led him back to love
and faith in human nature; and he never again regretted
his lost treasure, which had been so richly replaced by the
golden-haired child.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_DAISY_AND_THE_LARK"></a>THE DAISY AND THE LARK</h2>


<p>In the country, close by the roadside, stood a pleasant
house. In front lay a little garden, enclosed by a fence, and
full of blossoming flowers. Near the hedge, in the soft
green grass, grew a little daisy. The sun shone as brightly
and warmly upon her as it shone upon the large and beautiful
garden flowers.</p>

<p>The daisy grew from day to day. Every morning she
unfolded her white rays, and lifted up a little golden sun in
the centre of her blossom. She never remembered how little
she was. She never thought that she was hidden down in
the grass, while the tall beautiful flowers grew in the garden.
She was too happy to care for such things. She lifted her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
face towards the warm sun, she looked up to the blue sky,
and she listened to the lark singing high in the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p045.jpg" alt="Cottage, lark on fence" />
</div>

<p>One day the little daisy was as joyful as if it were a great
holiday, and yet it was only Monday. The little children
were at school. They sat at their desks learning their
lessons. The daisy, on her tiny stem, was learning from
the warm sun and the soft wind how good God is. Then the
lark sang his sweet song. “How beautiful, how sweet the
song is!” said the daisy. “What a happy bird to sing so
sweetly and fly so high!” But she never dreamed of
being sorry because she could not fly or sing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>The tall garden flowers by the fence were very proud
and conceited. The peonies thought it very grand to be
so large, and puffed themselves out to be larger than the
roses. “See how bright my colors are!” said the tulips.
And they stood bolt upright to be seen more plainly.
They did not notice the little daisy. She said to herself,
“How rich and beautiful they are! No wonder the pretty
bird likes them. I am glad I can live near them.”</p>

<p>Just then the lark flew down. “Tweet, tweet, tweet,”
he cried, but he did not go near the peonies and tulips.
He hopped into the grass near the lowly daisy. She
trembled for joy. The little bird sang beside her: “Oh,
what sweet, soft grass, and what a beautiful little flower,
with gold in its heart and silver on its dress!” How
happy the little daisy felt! And the bird kissed it
with his beak, sang to it, and then flew up into the blue
air above.</p>

<p>The daisy looked up at the peonies and the tulips, but
they were quite vexed, and turned their backs upon her.
She did not care, she was so happy. When the sun was
set, she folded up her leaves and went to sleep. All night
long she dreamed of the warm sun and the pretty little bird.
The next morning, when she stretched out her white
leaves to the warm air and the light, she heard the voice
of the lark, but his song was sad. Poor little lark! He
might well be sad: he had been made a prisoner in a cage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
that hung by the open window. He sang of the happy
time when he could fly in the air, joyous and free.</p>

<p>Just then two boys came into the garden. They came
straight to the daisy. One of them carried a sharp knife
in his hand. “We can cut a nice piece of turf for the
lark, here,” he said. And he cut a square piece of turf
around the daisy, so that the little flower stood in the
centre. He carried the piece of turf with the daisy
growing in it, and placed it in the lark’s cage.</p>

<p>“There is no water here,” said the captive lark. “All have
gone, and forgotten to give me a drop of water to drink.
My throat is hot and dry. I feel as if I were burning.”
And he thrust his beak into the cool turf to refresh himself
a little with the green grass. Within it was the daisy.
He nodded to her, and kissed her with his beak.</p>

<p>“Poor little flower! Have you come here, too?”</p>

<p>“How I wish I could comfort him,” said the daisy. And
she tried to fill the air with perfume.</p>

<p>The poor bird lay faint and weak on the floor of the cage.
His heart was broken. In the morning the boys came,
and when they found the bird was dead, they wept many
bitter tears. They dug a little grave for him, and covered
it with flowers. The piece of turf was thrown on the
ground.</p>

<p>The daisy had given her little life to make the captive
bird glad.</p>

<h2><a id="WEBSTER_AND_THE_WOODCHUCK"></a>WEBSTER AND THE WOODCHUCK</h2>


<p>On a farm among the hills of New Hampshire, in the
United States, there once lived a boy whose name was
Daniel Webster. He was a tiny fellow for one of his
age. His hair was jet black, and his eyes were so dark
and wonderful that nobody who once saw them could
ever forget them. He was not strong enough to help
much on the farm; and so he spent much of his time in
playing in the woods and fields. He loved the trees
and flowers and the harmless wild creatures that made
their homes among them.</p>

<p>But he did not play all the time. Long before he was old
enough to go to school, he learned to read; and he read so
well that everybody liked to hear him. The neighbors,
when driving past his father’s house, would stop their
horses and call for the boy to come out and read to them.</p>

<p>It happened one summer that a woodchuck made its
burrow in the side of a hill near Mr. Webster’s house. On
warm, dark nights it would come down into the garden and
eat the tender leaves of the cabbages and other plants that
were growing there. Nobody knew how much harm it might
do in the end. Daniel and his elder brother Ezekiel made
up their minds to catch the little thief. They tried this
thing and that, but for a long time he was too cunning for
them. Then they built a strong trap where the woodchuck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
would be sure to walk into it; and the next morning,
there he was.</p>

<p>“We have him at last!” cried Ezekiel. “Now, Mr.
Woodchuck, you’ve done mischief enough, and I’m going to
kill you.” But Daniel pitied the little animal. “No,
don’t hurt him,” he said. “Let us carry him over the hills,
far into the woods, and let him go.” Ezekiel, however,
would not agree to this. His heart was not so tender as his
little brother’s. He was bent on killing the woodchuck,
and laughed at the thought of letting it go.</p>

<p>“Let us ask father about it,” said Daniel.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Ezekiel; “I know what he will decide.”</p>

<p>They carried the trap, with the woodchuck in it, to their
father, and asked what they should do.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Mr. Webster, “we shall settle the
question in this way. We shall hold a court here. I shall
be the judge, and you shall be the lawyers. You shall each
plead your case, for or against the prisoner, and I shall
decide what his punishment shall be.”</p>

<p>Ezekiel, as the prosecutor, made the first speech. He told
about the mischief that had been done. He showed that all
woodchucks are bad and cannot be trusted. He spoke of
the time and labor that had been spent in trying to catch the
thief, and declared that if they should now set him free he
would be a worse thief than before.</p>

<p>“A woodchuck’s skin,” he said, “may perhaps be sold for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
ten cents. Small as that sum is, it will go a little way towards
paying for the cabbages he has eaten. But, if we set him
free, how shall we ever recover even a penny of what we have
lost? Clearly, he is of more value dead than alive, and
therefore he ought to be put out of the way at once.”</p>

<p>Ezekiel’s speech was a good one, and it pleased Mr.
Webster very much. What he said was true and to the
point, and it would be hard for Daniel to make any answer
to it.</p>

<p>Daniel began by pleading for the poor animal’s life. He
looked up into his father’s face, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“God made the woodchuck. He made him to live in the
bright sunlight and the pure air. He made him to enjoy
the free fields and the green woods. The woodchuck has a
right to his life, for God gave it to him.</p>

<p>“God gives us our food. He gives us all that we have.
And shall we refuse to share a little of it with this poor dumb
creature who has as much right to God’s gifts as we have?</p>

<p>“The woodchuck is not a fierce animal like the wolf or the
fox. He lives in quiet and peace. A hole in the side of a
hill, and a little food, is all he wants. He has harmed nothing
but a few plants, which he ate to keep himself alive.
He has a right to life, to food, to liberty; and we have no
right to say he shall not have them.</p>

<p>“Look at his soft, pleading eyes. See him tremble with
fear. He cannot speak for himself, and this is the only way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
in which he can plead for the life that is so sweet to him.
Shall we be so cruel as to kill him? Shall we be so selfish as
to take from him the life that God gave him?”</p>

<p>The father’s eyes were filled with tears as he listened.
His heart was stirred. He did not wait for Daniel to finish
his speech, but sprang to his feet, and as he wiped the tears
from his eyes, he cried out, “Ezekiel, let the woodchuck go!”</p>

<h2><a id="THE_LAST_LESSON_IN_FRENCH"></a>THE LAST LESSON IN FRENCH</h2>


<p>I was very late that morning on my way to school, and
was afraid of being scolded, as the master had told us he
should question us on the verbs, and I did not know the first
word, for I had not studied my lesson. For a moment I
thought of playing truant. The air was so warm and bright,
and I could hear the blackbirds whistling in the edge of the
woods, and the Prussians who were drilling in the meadow
behind the sawmill. I liked this much better than learning
the rules for verbs, but I did not dare to stop, so I ran
quickly towards school.</p>

<p>As I passed the mayor’s office, I saw people standing
before the little bulletin-board. For two years it was there
that we received all the news of battles, of victories, and
defeats. “What is it now?” I thought, without stopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
to look at the bulletin. Then, as I ran along, the blacksmith,
who was there reading the bill, cried out to me, “Not
so fast, little one, you shall reach your school soon enough.”
I thought he was laughing at me and ran faster than ever,
reaching the school yard quite out of breath.</p>

<p>Usually, at the beginning of school, a loud noise could be
heard from the street. Desks were being opened and closed,
and lessons repeated at the top of the voice. Occasionally
the heavy ruler of the master beat the table, as he cried,
“Silence, please, silence!” I hoped to be able to take my
seat in all this noise without being seen; but that morning
the room was quiet and orderly. Through the open window
I saw my schoolmates already in their places. The master
was walking up and down the room with the iron ruler under
his arm and a book in his hand. As I entered he looked at
me kindly, and said, without scolding, “Go quickly to your
place, little Franz; we were just going to begin without you.
You should have been here five minutes ago.”</p>

<p>I climbed over my bench and sat down at once at my desk.
Just then I noticed, for the first time, that our master wore
his fine green coat with the ruffled frills, and his black silk
embroidered cap. But what surprised me more was to see
some of the village people seated on the benches at the end
of the room. One of them was holding an old spelling-book
on his knee; and they all looked sadly at the master.</p>

<p>While I was wondering at this, our schoolmaster took his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
place, and in the same kind tone in which he had received
me, he said: “My children, this is the last time that I shall
give you a lesson. An order has come from Berlin that no
language but German may be taught in the schools of Alsace
and Lorraine. A new master will come to-morrow who
shall teach you in German. To-day is your last lesson in
French. I beg of you to pay good attention.”</p>

<p>These words frightened me. This is what they had posted
on the bulletin-board, then! This is what the blacksmith
was reading. My last lesson in French! I hardly knew
how to write, and I never should learn now. How I longed
for lost time, for hours wasted in the woods and fields, for
days when I had played and should have studied. My
books that a short time ago had seemed so tiresome, so
heavy to carry, now seemed to me like old friends. I was
thinking of this when I heard my name called. It was my
turn to recite. What would I not have given to be able to
say the rules without a mistake? But I could not say a
word and stood at my bench without daring to lift my
head. Then I heard the master speaking to me.</p>

<p>“I shall not scold you, little Franz. You are punished
enough now. Every day you have said to yourself: ‘I
have plenty of time. I shall learn my lesson to-morrow.’
Now you see what has happened.”</p>

<p>Then he began to talk to us about the French language,
saying that it was the most beautiful tongue in the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
and that we must keep it among us and never forget it.
Finally he took the grammar and read us the lesson. I was
surprised to see how I understood. Everything seemed
easy. I believe, too, that I never listened so well; and
it seemed almost as if the good man were trying to teach us
all he knew in this last lesson.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p060.jpg" alt="The French lesson" />
</div>

<p>The lesson in grammar ended, we began our writing. For
that day the master had prepared some new copies, on
which were written, “Alsace, France; Alsace, France.”
They seemed like so many little flags floating about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
schoolroom. How we worked! Nothing was heard but
the voice of the master and the scratching of pens on
the paper. There was no time for play now. On the roof
of the schoolhouse some pigeons were softly cooing, and I
said to myself, “Shall they, too, be obliged to sing in
German?”</p>

<p>From time to time, when I looked up from my page, I
saw the master looking about him as if he wished to impress
upon his mind everything in the room.</p>

<p>After writing, we had a history lesson, and then the little
ones recited. Oh, I shall remember that last lesson!</p>

<p>Suddenly, the church clock struck the hour of noon. The
master rose from his chair. “My friends,” said he, “my
friends,&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;” But something choked him; he
could not finish the sentence. He turned to the blackboard,
took a piece of chalk, and wrote in large letters, “<span class="smcap">Vive la
France</span>!” Then he stood leaning against the wall, unable
to speak. He signed to us with his hand: “It is ended.
You are dismissed.”</p>

<h2><a id="CAEDMON"></a>CÆDMON</h2>


<p>On one of the dark, rugged cliffs that jut out into the sea
from the eastern part of England, stood, many centuries
ago, the monastery of Whitby. At this time the people
of England were still very ignorant. Only the monks and
nuns knew how to read or write. The rest of the people
were either warriors, or else simple-minded shepherds and
farmers.</p>

<p>In this monastery lived a servant whose duty it was to
attend to the sheep and cattle. In the evenings, very often,
his companions were in the habit of gathering together in
the common hall or banquet room. There it was the custom,
while the feast was going on, for each one in turn to
take the harp as it was passed around the table, and make up
some simple song to entertain his friends. Although these
people knew nothing about reading or writing, they were
wonderfully clever at singing songs and accompanying
themselves on the harp.</p>

<p>Only the herdsman who attended to the sheep and cattle,
and whose name was Cædmon, could never sing. So
whenever the feasting time came, and his comrades began to
pass the harp from one to another, he, being ashamed of his
lack of skill, would leave the banquet hall to go alone to the
little house where he slept.</p>

<p>One night, after he had left his comrades, and had at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>tended
to all the wants of the cattle under his care, he, as
usual, went to sleep, and in his sleep he had a wonderful
dream. He dreamed that to his door came a beautiful
youth, with a light shining about his head, who said to him,
“Cædmon, sing for me.” Cædmon answered: “But thou
knowest I cannot sing. That is why I left my companions
in the banquet hall, and came here to my lonely hut.”
“Try,” said the beautiful youth, “and thou shalt find that
thou canst sing.” Then Cædmon in wonder asked, “What
shall I sing about?”&mdash;”Sing of the beauty of the world, and
the glory of the stars and the skies, and of all that is on the
earth,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Then in his sleep Cædmon sang a beautiful song, just as
the youth had commanded him. But the strangest thing
was that when he awoke he remembered every word of the
song, and not only that, but he found he could sing a song
about any thought that came into his mind; whereas,
formerly, he had never been able to sing at all.</p>

<p>Wonderful, indeed, all this seemed to the humble shepherd.
He told his companions about his dream, and they led him
to the abbess, who was chief in the monastery, and bade
him sing his songs for her.</p>

<p>So he sang. All the wise monks came to hear him, and
tears came into their eyes at the beauty of his song; for
when he sang, the sky and the earth and the sea these men
had known all their lives seemed suddenly to be filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
a new glory. They all said that Cædmon had received a
wonderful gift from God, and that he must use it in a
holy way.</p>

<p>From that day on some one else guarded the sheep and
the cattle in the monastery of Whitby; and the former
shepherd learned to read and write, and became one of the
monks of the abbey. Many and beautiful and holy were
the songs he wrote. They were written in Anglo-Saxon,
the language spoken by the ancestors of the English people,
and this simple shepherd, Cædmon, who was the first of the
Anglo-Saxon poets, was therefore really the father of all
English poetry.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_MINSTRELS_SONG"></a>THE MINSTREL’S SONG</h2>


<p>Once in the olden time a king called his heralds together
to hear his bidding. And all the swift runners gathered
before the king, each with a trumpet in his hand. And
the king sent them forth into every part of the kingdom
to sound their trumpets and to call aloud:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hear, O ye minstrels! Our gracious king bids ye come
to his court and play before the queen.”</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>


<p>The minstrels were men who went about from castle to
castle and from palace to cot, singing beautiful songs and
playing on harps. Wherever they roamed they were
always sure of a welcome. They sang of the brave deeds
that the knights had done, and of wars and battles. They
sang of the mighty hunters that hunted in the great forests.
They sang of fairies and goblins, of giants and elves. And
because there were no storybooks in those days, everybody,
from little children to the king, was glad to see them come.</p>

<p>When the minstrels heard the king’s message, they made
haste to the palace; and it so happened that three of them
met on the way and decided to travel together.</p>

<p>One of these minstrels was a young man named Harmonious;
and while the others talked of the songs that
they would sing, he gathered the wild flowers that grew
by the roadside.</p>

<p>“I can sing of drums and battles,” said the oldest minstrel,
whose hair was white, and whose step was slow.</p>

<p>“I can sing of ladies and their fair faces,” said the youngest
minstrel. But Harmonious whispered, “Listen! listen!”</p>

<p>“Oh! we hear nothing but the wind in the tree-tops,”
said the others. “We have not time to stop and listen.”</p>

<p>Then they hurried on and left Harmonious; and he stood
under the trees and listened, for he heard the wind singing
of its travels through the wide world. It was telling how
it raced over the blue sea, tossing the waves and rocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
the white ships. It sang of the hill where the trees made
harps of their branches, and of the valleys where all the
flowers danced gayly to its music. And this was the
chorus of the song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Nobody follows me where I go,</div>
  <div class="verse">Over the mountains or valley below;</div>
  <div class="verse">Nobody sees where the wild winds blow,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">Only the Father in Heaven can know.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Harmonious listened until he knew the whole song.
Then he ran on, and soon reached his friends, who were
still talking of the grand
sights that they were to
see. “We shall behold
the king, and we shall
speak to him,” said the
oldest minstrel. “And
we shall see his golden
crown and the queen’s
jewels,” added the
youngest.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/p071.jpg" alt="Harmonius in the wood listening" />
</div>


<p>Now their path led
them through the wood,
and as they talked,
Harmonious said,
“Hush! listen!” But
the others answered: “Oh! that is only the sound of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
brook, trickling over the stones. Let us make haste to the
king’s court.”</p>

<p>But Harmonious stayed to hear the song that the brook
was singing, of journeying through mosses and ferns and
shady ways, and of tumbling over the rocks in shining
waterfalls, on its way to the sea.</p>

  <div class="verse">For God in Heaven can always hear.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus sang the little brook. Harmonious listened until he
knew every word of the song, and then he hurried on.</p>

<p>When he reached the others, he found them still talking
of the king and the queen, so he could not tell them
of the brook. As they talked, he heard something again
that was wonderfully sweet, and he cried, “Listen! listen!”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is only a bird,” the others replied. “Let us
make haste to the king’s court.”</p>

<p>But Harmonious would not go, for the bird sang so joyfully
that Harmonious laughed aloud when he heard the
song. It was singing a song of green trees; and in every
tree there was a nest, and in every nest there were eggs.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Merrily, merrily, listen to me</div>
  <div class="verse">Flitting and flying from tree to tree;</div>
  <div class="verse">Nothing fear I, by land or sea,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">For God in Heaven is watching me.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>
<p>“Thank you, little bird,” said Harmonious; “you have
taught me a song.” And he made haste to join his comrades.</p>

<p>When they had come into the palace, they received a
hearty welcome, and were feasted in the great hall before
they came into the throne room. The king and queen sat
on their thrones side by side. The king thought of the
queen and the minstrels; but the queen thought of her old
home in a far-off country, and of the butterflies she had
chased when she was a little child.</p>

<p>One by one the minstrels played before them. The oldest
minstrel sang of battles and drums, and the soldiers
of the king shouted with joy. The youngest minstrel sang
of ladies and their fair faces, and all the ladies of the court
clapped their hands.</p>

<p>Then came Harmonious. And when he touched his harp
and sang, the song sounded like the wind blowing, the sea
roaring, and the trees creaking. Then it grew very soft,
and sounded like a trickling brook, dripping on stones and
running over little pebbles. And while the king and
queen and all the court listened in surprise, Harmonious’s
song grew sweeter, sweeter, sweeter. It was as if you
heard all the birds in spring. And then the song was
ended.</p>

<p>The queen clapped her hands, and the ladies waved their
handkerchiefs, and the king came down from his throne to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
ask Harmonious if he came from fairy-land with such a
wonderful song. But Harmonious answered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Three singers sang along our way,</div>
  <div class="verse">And I learned the song from them to-day.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now all the minstrels looked up in surprise when they
heard these words from Harmonious; and the oldest minstrel
said to the king: “Harmonious is surely mad! We
met no singers on our way to-day.” But the queen said:
“That is an old, old song. I heard it when I was a little
child, and I can name the singers three.” And so she did.

<h2><a id="THE_STORY_OF_MOWEEN"></a>THE STORY OF MOWEEN</h2>


<p>This is a story a hunter told me as we sat by the camp-fire
on the top of the mountain, after a day’s climb through the
woods:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When I was a child, my home was on the edge of a great
forest. There were but few people near us, and not a town
for miles and miles. Many wild animals lived in the woods,
which were so wide and deep that most of the animals had
never seen a human being.</p>

<p>“One day my father and a neighbor were out hunting.
There was no breeze, and the woods were very still. They
were walking down a hillside, stepping quietly over the fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
trunks and dry leaves, when suddenly, ‘Look! look!’ my
father whispered to his companion.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/p078.jpg" alt="Bears in wood" />
</div>

<p>“A strip of water gleamed through the trees, and a mother
bear and three cubs were walking along the shore. The bear
caught the sound or
the scent of some one
near, for she stopped,
rose on her hind legs,
and snuffed the air,
and all the little bears
did exactly what she
did. ‘We have surprised
Bruin giving
her children a lesson,’
said my father. But
as he turned to speak,
and before he could
say a word to prevent,
his companion had
shot the mother bear.
She tumbled down on the sand, and the little bears began
to whimper and cry.</p>

<p>“Father never spoke to that man again, though he was
a neighbor; and a neighbor means a good deal when the
nearest one lives two miles away.</p>

<p>“The cubs were brave fellows; they did not run away even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
when the men went up to them, but stayed by their mother,
whimpering a little. ‘It was pitiful to see them,’ father said.
He was not willing to go away and leave the little fellows,
for they were too small to take care of themselves; and now
they had no mother to teach them bear language and bear
ways. He picked up one and carried it, and the others followed.
So he brought the three bears home to be my
playmates, and glad I was to see them. They cried at first
and missed their mother; but they soon became accustomed
to living with people. What frolics we had! Every
morning we would scamper up and down the road. When
some one called in to the house and I ran in, they would
come running and tumbling after me. We played house
and school and soldier together, and though I often wished
they could talk with me, in every other way they were good
comrades.</p>

<p>“They were always good-natured. You have heard a
dog growl over a bone; the bears preferred lumps of sugar,
which they took without growling. How they liked sweet
things! They would come into the pantry and beg for cake;
and when my mother wanted to give us all a treat, she would
make molasses candy.</p>

<p>“Did we sell them? No, sir! Father said their mother
had been so cruelly treated that they deserved extra kindness,
and they were free to come and go as they would.</p>

<p>“One morning I woke up to find that two of them had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
gone off to the woods,&mdash;their natural home. Only Moween
had chosen to stay with us rather than to go with his
brothers. He lived with us until he was a big bear. Sometimes
he would roam into the woods to find honey, but he
always came back. I used to like to go nutting with him,
for he would climb up the tree and shake the branches until
the nuts came pattering down.</p>

<p>“One afternoon a German, leading a bear by a chain,
stopped at the house. He had lost his way, and we asked
him to rest and spend the night with us. He explained in
broken English that he had been travelling about the country
with his dancing bear. The bear danced for us, but
Moween seemed frightened and ran away when he saw the
newcomer. The dancing bear, on his part, seemed afraid of
Moween. However, at supper-time, Moween returned, and
the bears seemed to make friends. What they said to each
other I do not know, but when morning came both bears
were gone. The dancing bear had slipped his chain. Their
trail led into the forest, and we followed it a mile or two,
but did not find them.</p>

<p>“This time my pet bear did not come back. Every spring
I used to expect him, for when the maple trees were tapped,
we had ‘sugarings off’ which were always feasts for Moween.
But I have not seen him since, though I never see a bear
without wishing that he were my old playmate, Moween.”</p>

<h2><a id="THE_BOY_MUSICIAN"></a>THE BOY MUSICIAN</h2>


<p>There was a time, long ago, when people believed that
fairies hovered over a sleeping babe, and gave to the little
one the charm of beauty, or the joy of strength, or the
power of genius.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/p083.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Mozart</span></div>
</div>

<p>If this were true, then fairies must have visited the cradle
of little Wolfgang Mozart. We might easily believe that
one of them said, “I shall give
thee a loving heart;” and that
another whispered, “Thou shalt
delight in sweet sounds; music
shall be thy language.”</p>

<p>The little Mozart lived in Germany
more than a hundred years
ago. His father was a musician,
and his sister, Anna, had already
made rapid progress in music.
At all of her lessons the baby
brother was an interested listener, and he often amused himself
in trying to repeat the exercises he had heard. Before
he was four years old, he began to compose music. His little
pieces were written for him by his father, in a book which
was kept for that purpose.</p>

<p>One Sunday the father came home from church and
found Wolfgang at a table busy over a piece of paper. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a><br /><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
fat little hand grasped the pen with much firmness, and at
every visit to the ink-bottle he plunged it to the very bottom.
The paper was very badly blotted with ink, but the baby
composer calmly wiped away the blots with his finger and
wrote over them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p084.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Mozart playing before the Queen of Prussia</span></div>
</div>

<p>“What are you doing there?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“Writing a piece of music for the piano,” replied
Wolfgang.</p>

<p>“Let me see it.”</p>

<p>“No, no, it is not ready!”</p>

<p>The father took up the paper, and laughed at the big
blots and the notes which were scarcely readable. But
upon looking over the work more carefully, he saw that it
was written according to rule, and that it was a wonderful
composition for so young a child.</p>

<p>The father now devoted all his time to the education of
his two children. They progressed so rapidly that they were
a marvel to their native town. When Anna was ten years
old and Wolfgang six, they were taken by their father and
mother to Vienna, and there the Emperor listened to their
music. The courtiers and the royal family praised the gifted
children and filled their hands with costly presents.</p>

<p>Soon after their return home, a noted violinist called to
ask Herr Mozart’s opinion of some new music. As they
were about to practise the different parts, little Wolfgang
begged to play second violin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>“You cannot join our rehearsal,” said his father. “You
have had no instruction on the violin.”</p>

<p>“I do not need any lessons to play second violin,” the
boy persisted.</p>

<p>“Run away and do not disturb us,” was the father’s
reply, and the little boy walked out of the room, crying
bitterly. The visitor begged that the child be permitted
to play with him, and Wolfgang was called back.</p>

<p>“Play then,” said the father; “but play very softly.”</p>

<p>The child was comforted. He brushed away his tears
and began playing, softly at first, as he had been commanded;
then he forgot everything but the notes before
him, and the music swelled higher and higher. All were
amazed, and tears of gladness stood in the father’s eyes.</p>

<p>Another concert tour was planned, and Wolfgang and
his sister travelled with their parents from city to city,
giving concerts at the courts of kings. Great crowds went
to hear them, and everywhere they were greeted with
enthusiasm and delight.</p>

<p>When Wolfgang was eleven years old, he went to Italy
to study music. The fair, slender lad was looked upon as
a marvel by the Italian musicians. The father and son
reached Rome at the time of the great Easter festival. A
beautiful piece of music had been set apart as sacred to
this yearly service. For two hundred years it had been
carefully guarded, and all musicians were forbidden to copy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
it. Wolfgang listened intently; and when he came again
the next day to the church, he brought with him a folded
paper on which he had written from memory the whole of
the sacred music.</p>

<p>“Truly such wonderful gifts come from Heaven!” said
the priests, in awe and admiration.</p>

<p>Mozart remained for nearly two years in Italy, studying
with the finest musicians and hearing the best music. After
his return to his native land, he continued his musical studies
and gave his whole life to his art.</p>

<p>It seems impossible that the boy, who in his
early years received such honors, should in his manhood
meet poverty and neglect. Such was Mozart’s sad fortune,
but in spite of his discouragements he struggled on, and
became one of the greatest of musical composers. He has
given to the world a wealth of beauty that has made his
name immortal.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bertha Leary Saunders.</span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_FLAX"></a>THE FLAX</h2>


<p>The flax was in full bloom; it had pretty little blue flowers
as delicate as the wings of a moth, or even more so. The
sun shone, and the showers watered it, so that it became
very beautiful.</p>

<p>“People say that I look exceedingly well,” said the flax,
“and that I am so fine and long, that I shall make an excellent
piece of linen. How fortunate
I am! it makes me so
happy; it is such a pleasant thing
to know that something can be
made of me. How the sunshine
cheers me, and how sweet and
refreshing is the rain! no one in
the world can feel happier than
I do.”</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/p091.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Hans Andersen</span></div>
</div>

<p>One day some people came,
who took hold of the flax and
pulled it up by the roots; this was painful. Then it was
laid in water as if they intended to drown it, and, after
that, placed near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this
was very shocking.</p>

<p>“I cannot expect to be happy always,” said the flax;
“I must have my trials, and so learn what life really is.”
And certainly there were plenty of trials in store for the flax.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
It was steeped, and roasted, and broken, and combed; indeed,
it scarcely knew what was done to it.</p>

<p>At last it was put on the spinning-wheel. “Whirr, whirr,”
went the wheel, so quickly that the flax could not collect
its thoughts.</p>

<p>“Well, I have been very happy,” he thought in the midst
of his pain, “and must be contented with the past;” and
contented he remained till he was put on the loom, and
became a beautiful piece of white linen. All the flax, even
to the last stalk, was used in making this one piece.
“How wonderful it is that, after all I have suffered,
I am made something of at last; I am the luckiest
person in the world&mdash;so strong and fine; and how white,
and what a length! This is something different from
being a mere plant and bearing flowers. I cannot be
happier than I am now.”</p>

<p>After some time, the linen was taken into the house,
placed under the scissors, and cut and torn into pieces,
and then pricked with needles. This certainly was not
pleasant; but at last it was made into garments.</p>

<p>“See now, then,” said the flax, “I have become something
of importance. This was my destiny; it is quite a
blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the world, as every
one ought to be; it is the only way to be happy.”</p>

<p>Years passed away; and at last the linen was so worn
it could scarcely hold together. “It must end very soon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>”
said the pieces to each other. “We would gladly have held
together a little longer, but we must not forget that there is
an end to all things.” And at length they fell into rags and
tatters, and thought it was all over with them, for they were
torn to shreds, and steeped in water and made into a pulp,
and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at once
they found themselves beautiful white paper.</p>

<p>“Well, now, this is a surprise; a glorious surprise, too,”
said the paper. “I am now finer than ever, and I shall
be written upon, and who can tell what fine things I may
have written upon me? This is wonderful luck!” And
sure enough, the most beautiful stories and poetry were
written upon it. Then people heard the stories and poetry
read, and it made them wiser and better; for all that was
written was sensible and good, and a great blessing was
contained in the words on the paper.</p>

<p>“I never imagined anything like this,” said the paper,
“when I was only a little blue flower, growing in the fields.
How could I imagine that I should ever be the means of
bringing knowledge and joy to men? I cannot understand
it myself, and yet it is really so. I suppose now I shall be
sent on my travels about the world, so that people may read
me. It cannot be otherwise; indeed, it is more than probable,
for I have more splendid thoughts written upon me
than I had pretty flowers in olden times. I am happier
than ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>But the paper did not go on its travels. It was sent to
the printer, and all the words written upon it were set up in
type, to make a book, or rather hundreds of books; for so
many more persons could gain pleasure from a printed book
than from the written paper; and if the paper had been
sent about the world, it would have been worn out before it
had got half through its journey.</p>

<p>“This is certainly the wisest plan,” said the written
paper; “I really did not think of that. I shall remain at
home and be held in honor, like some old grandfather, as I
really am to all these new books. They shall do some good.
I could not have wandered about as they do. Yet he who
wrote all this has looked at me as every word flowed from
his pen upon my surface. I am the most honored of all.”</p>

<p>Then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers,
and thrown into a tub that stood in the wash-house.
“After work, it is well to rest,” said the paper. “Now
I am able for the first time to think of my life and all the
good that I have done. What shall be done with me now,
I wonder? No doubt I shall still go forward.”</p>

<p>Now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub
was taken out, and laid on the hearth to be burnt. People
said it could not be sold at the shop, to wrap up butter and
sugar, because it had been written upon. The children in
the house stood round the stove; for they wished to see the
paper burn, because it flamed up so prettily, and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>wards,
among the ashes, so many red sparks could be seen
running one after the other, here and there, as quick as the
wind.</p>

<p>The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire,
and was soon alight. “Oh, oh!” cried the paper, as it
burst into a bright flame. It was certainly not very pleasant
to be burning; but when the whole was wrapped in
flames, the flames mounted up into the air, higher than the
flax had ever been able to raise its little blue flower; and
they gleamed as the white linen had never been able to gleam.
All the written letters became quite red in a moment, and
all the words and thoughts turned into fire.</p>

<p>“Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,” said a
voice in the flames, and it was as if a thousand voices
echoed the words; and the flames darted up through the
chimney, and went out at the top. Nothing remained of
the paper but black ashes with the red sparks dancing
over them. The children thought that this was the end,
but the sparks sang, “The most beautiful is yet to come.”</p>

<h2><a id="THE_MAID_OF_ORLEANS"></a>THE MAID OF ORLEANS</h2>


<p>In the midst of those terrible times, during which for one
hundred years England and France were at war, there was
born in the little village of Domrémy a peasant girl, named
Jeanne d’Arc. When she was old enough she used to tend
her father’s sheep, and as she sat on the hillside, watching
them day by day, she often looked out over the ruined houses
and blackened fields and wondered if the English would ever
come again to frighten her people and burn their peaceful
homes. Her father, too, feared the same, and so taught his
little daughter to ride a horse and to use simple weapons.</p>

<p>Later she heard that the dreaded English were back in
France, not in her own village, but besieging the brave town
of Orleans. News came that the Dauphin, who was now
governing France, dared not go to Rheims to be crowned,
because the English troops held the place. One day as
Jeanne sat musing over all these rumors, wishing that she
were a man so that she might go and fight for her country,
she saw a vision and heard voices bidding her leave her home
and deliver the Dauphin from his enemies, so that he might
be crowned king. So loudly and so plainly did she hear
these voices that she felt she must go to the French court at
once. She was so poor that she thought at first that she
must go afoot, but some kind neighbors gave her a horse.
Then she put on men’s clothing, instead of her coarse red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a><br /><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
dress, cut off her long black hair, and rode bravely off
alone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p099.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap1">Ingres</p>
<p class="pcap2">Jeanne d’Arc</p></div>
</div>

<p>The journey was long and perilous, for the country was
still full of robbers and free lances, but when it was over she
found that her troubles had only begun. The nobles met
her strange story with laughter and scorn, and refused to let
her see the king. But finally her sweetness and gentle
manner prevailed, and she was led into the presence of her
sovereign. The story runs that the king, to test her, had
put on the simple robe of a courtier, and stood among the
rest of the nobles when Jeanne entered. But Jeanne went
to him, without hesitation, saluted, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In God’s name, it is you, sire, and none other.”</p>

<p>There she stood, a simple shepherd lass, who could
neither read nor write, before a roomful of men of noble
birth; but she was not afraid, for she brought with her the
faith that she was to save France. Gradually, her soft voice,
ringing with enthusiasm and loyalty, aroused the king
and his lords, and he granted Jeanne her request&mdash;she
was to go and relieve Orleans.</p>

<p>He gave her a big horse and pure white armor, and she
herself sent for a sword having five crosses on the blade,
that she had seen in a dream lying behind an altar in a certain
church.</p>

<p>But at Orleans the people who were defending the city
mistrusted her. They tried to hide their plans from her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
and made a secret attack in the night on the enemy. But
the shouts of war woke her from her sleep. She hastily
called for her horse and galloped into the midst of the fight.
The soldiers cheered her wildly, and now even the unwilling
captains were forced to listen to her. In the days that
followed, Jeanne, though twice wounded, was always at
the front, urging on the French and terrifying the English,
who took her for a witch. She entered Orleans on Friday,
and a week from the following Sunday the English had
turned their backs forever on the city.</p>

<p>Jeanne did not linger to enjoy her triumph. Amid the
tears of joy and the cheering of the people, she rode out of
the city the next day to perform the rest of her task,&mdash;to
crown the Dauphin king of France. From far and near people
came to see her, and a large army sprang up around her
and the king, eager to march towards Rheims. Still the
court delayed, for the nobles were jealous of Jeanne’s glory,
but she was firm in her faith and the people were with her.</p>

<p>The French first attacked the English who were holding
Troyes. After a six days’ siege the king was discouraged,
for the food was growing very scarce, but
Jeanne begged him to hold out two days longer. When
he agreed, she mounted her horse and led the attack
against the town. The English, in terror, opened
their gates before the assault began. Thus the last
difficulty was surmounted and the army marched safely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
to Rheims. Here the king was crowned in the big cathedral,
the brave young peasant girl standing by his side.</p>

<p>Jeanne was now ready to go back to her father and
mother, and the tending of her sheep, but the voices still
called her to drive the English from the land. She stayed
with the king and army, trying to hasten an attack on the
English. But the indolent king, listening to idle tales
from his jealous nobles, forgot all Jeanne had done for him
and France, and began to believe that she was a witch.
At last Jeanne was captured by the enemy. The English
believed her to be a witch and tried her for sorcery. The
French king made no effort to ransom her, and she was condemned
to be burned at the stake. The sentence was
carried out, and thus the poor peasant girl gave up her life
for the ungrateful country she had saved from ruin.</p>

<h2><a id="IKTOMI_AND_THE_COYOTE"></a>IKTOMI AND THE COYOTE</h2>


<p>Afar off upon a large level land, a summer sun was shining
bright. Here and there over the rolling green were tall
bunches of coarse gray weeds. Iktomi in his fringed buckskins
walked alone across the prairie with a black bare head
glossy in the sunlight. He walked through the grass without
following any well-worn footpath.</p>

<p>From one large bunch of coarse weeds to another he
wound his way about the great plain. He lifted his foot
lightly and placed it gently forward like a wildcat prowling
noiselessly through the thick grass. He stopped a few steps
away from a very large bunch of wild sage. From shoulder
to shoulder he tilted his head. Still farther he bent from
side to side. Far forward he stooped, stretching his long
thin neck like a duck, to see what lay under a fur coat beyond
the bunch of coarse grass.</p>

<p>A sleek gray-faced prairie wolf! his pointed black nose
tucked in between his four feet drawn snugly together; his
handsome bushy tail wound over his nose and feet; a coyote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
fast asleep in the shadow of a bunch of grass!&mdash;this is what
Iktomi spied. Carefully he raised one foot and cautiously
reached out with his toes. Gently, gently he lifted the foot
behind and placed it before the other. Thus he came nearer
and nearer to the round fur ball lying motionless under the
sage grass.</p>

<p>Now Iktomi stood beside it, looking at the closed eyelids
that did not quiver the least bit. Pressing his lips into
straight lines and nodding his head slowly, he bent over the
wolf. He held his ear close to the coyote’s nose, but not a
breath of air stirred from it.</p>

<p>“Dead!” said he at last. “Dead, but not long since he
ran over these plains! See! there in his paw is caught a
fresh feather. He is nice fat meat!” Taking hold of the
paw with the bird feather fast on it, he exclaimed, “Why,
he is still warm! I’ll carry him to my dwelling and have a
roast for my evening meal. Ah-ha!” he laughed, as he
seized the coyote by its two fore paws and its two hind feet
and swung him overhead across his shoulders. The wolf
was large and the teepee was far across the prairie. Iktomi
trudged along with his burden, smacking his hungry lips
together. He blinked his eyes hard to keep out the salty
perspiration streaming down his face.</p>

<p>All the while the coyote on his back lay gazing into the
sky with wide-open eyes. His long white teeth fairly
gleamed as he smiled and smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>“To ride on one’s own feet is tiresome, but to be carried
like a warrior from a brave fight is great fun!” said the
coyote in his heart. He had never been borne on any one’s
back before and the new experience delighted him. He lay
there lazily on Iktomi’s shoulders, now and then blinking
blue winks. Did you never see a bird blink a blue wink?
This is how it first became a saying among the plains people.
When a bird stands aloof watching your strange ways, a
thin bluish white tissue slips quickly over his eyes and as
quickly off again; so quick that you think it was only a
mysterious blue wink. Sometimes when children grow
drowsy they blink blue winks, while others who are too
proud to look with friendly eyes upon people blink in
this cold bird-manner.</p>

<p>The coyote was affected by both sleepiness and pride.
His winks were almost as blue as the sky. In the midst of
his new pleasure the swaying motion ceased. Iktomi had
reached his dwelling-place. The coyote felt drowsy no
longer, for in the next instant he was slipping out of Iktomi’s
hands. He was falling, falling through space, and then he
struck the ground with such a bump he did not wish to
breathe for a while. He wondered what Iktomi would do,
so he lay still where he fell. Humming a dance-song, Iktomi
hopped and darted about at an imaginary dance and
feast. He gathered dry willow sticks and broke them in
two against his knee. He built a large fire out-of-doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>The flames leaped up high in red and yellow streaks.
Now Iktomi returned to the coyote, who had been looking
on through his eyelashes.</p>

<p>Taking him again by his paws and hind feet, he swung
him to and fro. Then as the wolf swung towards the red
flames, Iktomi let him go. Once again the coyote fell
through space. Hot air smote his nostrils. He saw red
dancing fire, and now he struck a bed of crackling embers.
With a quick turn he leaped out of the flames. From his
heels were scattered a shower of red coals upon Iktomi’s
bare arms and shoulders. Dumfounded, Iktomi thought
he saw a spirit walk out of his fire. His jaws fell apart.
He thrust a palm to his face, hard over his mouth! He could
scarce keep from shrieking.</p>

<p>Rolling over and over on the grass and rubbing the sides
of his head against the ground, the coyote soon put out the
fire on his fur. Iktomi’s eyes were almost ready to jump
out of his head as he stood cooling a burn on his brown arm
with his breath.</p>

<p>Sitting on his haunches, on the opposite side of the fire
from where Iktomi stood, the coyote began to laugh at him.

<h2><a id="SIR_EDWIN_LANDSEER"></a>SIR EDWIN LANDSEER</h2>


<p>In the great South Kensington Museum in England there
are many beautiful pictures, painted by famous artists. In
one corner there is a little lead-pencil sketch of a donkey’s
head, and visitors to the gallery used to ask the guide how
it came there. The old man would point to the name below
the sketch and say, “Why, that is Sir Edwin Landseer’s,
and done when he was only five years old.” This is true,
for the little drawing is marked, “E. Landseer, five years
old.”</p>

<p>The little boy who did such wonderful work lived in a
happy home in the great city of London. Not far from his
home was a beautiful field called Hampstead Heath, and it
was on this delightful playground that Edwin and his older
brothers spent some of the happiest hours of their lives.
While the others were burying each other in the grass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
riding the old horse, or romping with the dogs, little curly-headed
Edwin would be sitting under a tree, trying to make
pictures. Sometimes his sister would sit by his side and
watch the pencil as his baby
fingers guided it. Very soon
she would see a horse’s head on
the paper and would recognize
their own old Dobbin. “How
good it is!” she would exclaim,
“What a famous little artist
you are!”</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/p111.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sir Edwin Landseer</span></div>
</div>

<p>Edwin learned some wonderful
lessons on Hampstead Heath.
When he would beg to be taught
to draw, his father would say: “Study things as God has
made them, my boy. Your own eyes must be your first
teachers.”</p>

<p>Of course the little boy was sent to school. He loved to
read, but did not like to study. Sometimes his teacher
would see him with his eyes shut and his hand moving on the
desk. He was thinking of a picture. Drawing was not
taught in the schools in those days and boys were punished
if they were caught drawing pictures during school hours;
so Edwin often ran away from his teachers, and they would
find him in a quiet corner, with his slate, drawing the picture
of some animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>Wherever animals were to be seen in London, there Edwin
was to be found. He generally carried his sketch book with
him, and pictured the animals eating, walking about, asleep,
or at play. Sometimes he would go to the London Zoölogical
Gardens, and after he had watched the wild beasts for
hours he would come away with many sketches. There
was also a great market in London where wild animals were
to be seen, and the boy, who was generally followed by two
or more dogs, became very familiar to the people who came
to the market.</p>

<img src="images/p112.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sir Edwin Landseer</span>   <span class="smcap">The Highland Shepherd’s Chief Mourner</span></div>
</div>

<p>When he was old enough Edwin was sent to the Artists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>’
Academy in London. He was a great favorite in the school,
and one famous artist always called him the “Dog-boy.”
He was very happy here and for the next few years devoted
his time to the study of animals and how to paint them.</p>

<p>After a time Landseer had so many pictures, and wished to
keep so many dogs, sheep, and deer, that it seemed necessary
that he should have a home of his own where he could receive
his friends. A pretty little cottage in St. John’s Wood
near London was found to be just the place he desired.
There was an old-fashioned garden filled with large trees
and beautiful flowers. The new home was named “Maida
Vale,” in honor of Sir Walter Scott’s favorite dog.</p>

<p>An old barn was fitted up for a studio, which was soon
made beautiful with pictures of all kinds of animals. There
were graceful greyhounds, kind-faced sheep dogs, faithful
terriers, soft rabbits, cunning kittens, spirited race horses,
and fleet-footed deer. The pictures looked so real that a
witty friend of the artist used to call out before he entered
the studio, “Landseer, keep your dogs off me; I want to
come in.” On another occasion this same friend said, “O,
give me a pin to take the thorn out of that dog’s foot!
See what pain he is suffering!”</p>

<p>Everybody wished to visit this delightful studio, and meet
the great painter who was so kind and witty, who loved
flowers and children so well, and who had so many interesting
friends around him. His visitors were astonished at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
great power in training dogs, and gaining their love. When
asked the secret, he would smile and say, “I just peep into
their hearts.” One day he was entertaining some friends
at Maida Vale when the door was pushed open and four
great dogs bounded in. One lady was frightened, and as a
fierce-looking dog ran past her and put his nose in Landseer’s
hand, she said, “How fond of you that dog is!” “Yes,”
said the artist, quietly, “but I never saw this dog before in
my life.”</p>

<p>Landseer was a great friend of Sir Walter Scott, whom he
often visited at his home. How he loved the wild scenery
and the tender-hearted fearless people of that North Country!
How he loved to climb the mountains and watch the
shy, beautiful deer as they bounded over the crags! No
artist ever painted deer like Landseer.</p>

<p>One day when he was at work in his studio, Landseer
was told that Queen Victoria was riding up the garden path.
He went to meet her, and she told him she wished him to see
her mounted on her horse, so that he might paint her picture.
She invited him to be her guest, and he painted a great many
pictures of her children and their pets. In 1850, the Queen
decided to confer on him the honor of knighthood; so the
artist, who was now known all over the world, became Sir
Edwin Landseer.</p>

<p>After this he received many great honors. He spent the
last years of a happy, busy life in the pretty Maida Vale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
cottage. As he grew old he talked about his “worn-out,
old pencil,” and complained that drawing tired him. It
was a trial for him to give up his work, and his eyes were
often sad as he looked at his beautiful pictures.</p>

<p>Landseer died in 1873, and was buried in St. Paul’s
Cathedral, in London. Copies of his pictures are in every
land and in almost every home. He will always be remembered
as a lover of animals as well as a great artist.</p>

<h2><a id="HOW_SIEGFRIED_MADE_THE_SWORD"></a>HOW SIEGFRIED MADE THE SWORD</h2>


<p>In Saxon land there once lived a young prince named
Siegfried. His father, who was renowned for his wisdom
and good deeds, was king of a rich and happy country that
reached to the great North Sea. His mother, the gentle
queen, was beloved by all, both high and low, for her goodness
of heart and her kindly charity to all who were in distress.
Both the king and the queen left nothing undone
to fit the young prince for a happy and useful life. They
chose for him the best and wisest teachers; every day they
saw that something was added to his store of knowledge and
his stock of happiness. As he grew in stature it was their
concern that he should grow in skill and strength also. No
other youth of his age could run more swiftly or ride more
easily; no other youth could shoot the arrow with surer aim
or throw the spear with greater force.</p>

<p>But the wise old king knew that a good man’s life consisted
of more than learning lessons and playing games. “All
work is noble,” said he to Siegfried; “he who yearns to win
fame must not shun toil. Even princes should learn how
to earn their bread by the labor of their hands.” So the king
sent his son to live with a smith called Mimer, that he might
learn the smith’s trade and hear his words of wisdom.</p>

<p>This Mimer had built his smithy among the hills by the
edge of a great forest. On the side of one of the hills over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>looking
the forest there was a fountain in which skill and
wisdom lay hidden. By drinking daily at this fountain as
the sun was rising, Mimer had become the most skilful of
smiths and the wisest of men.</p>

<p>Siegfried had now to lay aside his courtly garments and
put on a coarse blouse and leathern apron; for the dainties
of a king’s table he had to exchange the humble fare of a
smith’s apprentice. But he did not complain. His days
were mirthful and happy; the sound of his hammer echoed
musically among the hills, and the sparks from his forge flew
like showers of stars from morn till night. He took such delight
in his work that he soon became the cleverest workman
in the smithy except Mimer himself. He could twist
the links of the heaviest chains and fashion the most delicate
ornaments of steel.</p>

<p>One morning the apprentices saw that their master wore
a troubled look. He told them that Amilias, the chief
smith in another land, had made a coat of armor which he
boasted that neither sword could pierce, nor spear could
scratch, and he had sent a challenge to the chief smiths
of all other lands to equal his workmanship, or acknowledge
him as their master. He had been toiling all the day and
night to forge a sword that would pierce the armor, but
he had failed. He asked, “Is there any one here skilful
enough to forge such a sword?”</p>

<p>All the apprentices shook their heads. But Siegfried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
spoke up: “Give me leave; I shall try to forge the
sword that shall cut the armor of Amilias.” All the
others laughed at him in scorn, but Mimer said to them,
“Let us see what he can do; if he fail, I shall make him
repent his pride.”</p>

<p>Siegfried went to his task. For seven days the sparks
flew from his anvil. On the eighth day the sword was
tempered and he brought it to Mimer. “This seems, indeed,”
said Mimer, “a fair edge. Let us try its keenness.”
Then he threw a thread upon the water, and as it lay there
he struck it with the sword. The blade passed through the
thread without disturbing the ends or the surface of the
water. “Well done, lad!” exclaimed the smith; “never
have I seen a keener edge.”</p>

<p>But Siegfried said to himself, “I can make a better sword
than that, and there yet is time.” So for three days more he
welded it in a white hot fire and tempered it in buttermilk
and oatmeal. Then in sight of Mimer and the apprentices
he threw a ball of wool upon the water, and whirling the
blade in air brought it down upon the ball and parted it clean
in two without moving a thread out of place.</p>

<p>Still there was time, and back to his corner of the smithy
went Siegfried again. His hammer rang with a cheerier
sound than ever. For seven weeks he worked at the forge,
and at last, pale but smiling, he stood before Mimer with the
finished gleaming sword. Mimer looked at the edge which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
gleamed like a ray of light, but he said nothing, and seemed
lost in thought. Then Siegfried, taking the weapon in his
own hand, swung the blade high over his head, and brought
it down upon the anvil. The huge iron block was divided
in two. Then to the brook they went, and throwing a fleece
of wool upon the water the sword stroke separated it as
easily as the ball had been cut before. “With that sword,”
cried Mimer, “I shall not fear to meet Amilias.”</p>

<p>Heralds were sent abroad through the two kingdoms to
proclaim the day when the test would be made. Other kings
heard of the contest and came with their retinues of warriors
to witness the trial. There were four kings with their queens
and many fair ladies and courtly knights in armor. Multitudes
gathered to the height of land that separated the
kingdoms.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, Amilias clad in the coat of
armor went to the top of the hill and sat upon a great rock,
where he was in full sight of all the people. He smiled to
see Mimer toiling up the steep hill with that slight sword by
his side; the countrymen of Amilias gave a shout of triumph,
so sure were they of their champion’s success. But
Mimer’s countrymen waited in breathless silence. They
had faith in Mimer, but they greatly feared. Only Siegfried’s
father seemed confident. He whispered to his queen,
“Wisdom and skill are stronger than steel.”</p>

<p>When Mimer reached the top of the hill, he paused a mo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>ment
to take breath and to cast a glance on the crowds
below.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Ready,” answered Amilias, with a composed smile, so
little did he fear; “strike your strongest!”</p>

<p>Mimer swung the gleaming blade,&mdash;for a moment
the lightning seemed to play around his head, and then
descending, it made a sweep through the air from right to
left. The spectators thought to hear the clash of steel,
but no sound came to their ears save a hiss like that which
a hot poker would make in a bucket of water.</p>

<p>“Stand!” cried Mimer.</p>

<p>Amilias began to obey when, lo! he fell in halves, for the
sword had cut through the war coat and the body incased
within. One half rolled down the steep hill and fell into
the river, fathoms deep, where for many a day, when the
water was clear, it could be seen lying among the gravel
and rocks.</p>

<p>The king was right: wisdom and skill had proved themselves
stronger than steel.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Selected.</span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_GOLD_AND_SILVER_SHIELD"></a>THE GOLD AND SILVER SHIELD</h2>


<p>In the olden times a British prince set up a statue to the
goddess of Victory, at a point where four roads met. In her
right hand she held a spear, and her left rested upon a shield.
The outside of this shield was of gold, and the inside of silver,
and on each side was an inscription.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p126.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Gold and Silver Shield</span></div>
</div>

<p>It happened one day that two knights&mdash;one in black
armor, the other in white&mdash;arrived at the same time, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a><br /><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
from opposite directions, at the statue. As neither of them
had seen it before, they stopped to examine the beautiful
workmanship and read the inscription.</p>

<p>“This golden shield,” said the Black Knight, after examining
it for some time,&mdash;”this golden shield&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Golden shield!” cried the White Knight, who was as
closely observing the other side; “why, if I have my eyes,
it is silver.”</p>

<p>“Eyes you have, but they see not,” replied the Black
Knight; “for if ever I saw a golden shield in my life, this
is one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is so likely that any one would expose a golden
shield on the public road!” said the White Knight, with a
sarcastic smile. “For my part I wonder that even a silver
one is not too strong a temptation for some people who pass
this way.”</p>

<p>The Black Knight could not bear the sarcastic smile with
which this was spoken, and the dispute grew so warm that
it ended in a challenge.</p>

<p>The knights turned their horses, and rode back to have
sufficient space; then fixing their lances in their rests, they
charged at each other with the greatest fury. The shock
was so violent, and the blows on each side were so heavy,
that they both fell to the ground, bleeding and stunned.</p>

<p>In this condition a good Druid who was travelling that
way found them. He was a skilful physician, and had with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
him a balsam of wonderful healing power. This he applied
to their wounds, and when the knights had recovered their
senses, he began to inquire into the cause of their quarrel.</p>

<p>“Why, this man,” cried the Black Knight, “will have it
that yonder shield is silver!”</p>

<p>“And he will have it that it is gold!” cried the White
Knight.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the Druid, with a sigh, “you are both in the
right, and both in the wrong. If either of you had taken
time to look at both sides of the shield, all this passion and
bloodshed might have been avoided.</p>

<p>“However, there is a very good lesson to be learned from
the evils that have befallen you. In the future, never enter
into any dispute till you have fairly considered both sides
of the question.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Selected.</span></p>

<h2><a id="CROESUS"></a>CRŒSUS</h2>


<p>Some thousands of years ago there lived in Asia a king
whose name was Crœsus. The country over which he ruled
was not very large, but its people were prosperous and
famed for their wealth. Crœsus himself was said to be the
richest man in the world; and so well known is his name that,
to this day, it is not uncommon to say of a very wealthy
person that he is “as rich as Crœsus.”</p>

<p>King Crœsus had everything that could make him happy&mdash;lands
and houses and slaves, fine clothing to wear, and
beautiful things to look at. He could not think of anything
that he needed to make him more comfortable or
contented. “I am the happiest man in the world,” he said.</p>

<p>It happened one summer that a great man from across the
sea was travelling in Asia. The name of this man was Solon,
and he was the lawmaker of Athens in Greece. He was
noted for his wisdom; and, centuries after his death, the
highest praise that could be given to a learned man was to
say, “He is as wise as Solon.”</p>

<p>Solon had heard of Crœsus, and so one day he visited him
in his beautiful palace. Crœsus was now happier and
prouder than ever before, for the wisest man in the world
was his guest. He led Solon through his palace and showed
him the grand rooms, the fine carpets, the soft couches,
the rich furniture, the pictures, the books. Then he in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>vited
him out to see his gardens and his orchards and his
stables; and he showed him thousands of rare and beautiful
things that he had collected from all parts of the world.</p>

<p>In the evening as the wisest of men and the richest of
men were dining together, the king said to his guest, “Tell
me now, O Solon, who do you think is the happiest of all
men?” He expected that Solon would say “Crœsus.”</p>

<p>The wise man was silent for a minute, and then he said,
“I have in mind a poor man who once lived in Athens and
whose name was Tellus. He, I doubt not, is the happiest
of all men.”</p>

<p>This was not the answer that Crœsus wished; but he hid
his disappointment and asked, “Why do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Because,” answered his guest, “Tellus was an honest
man who labored hard for many years to bring up his children
and to give them a good education; and when they were
grown and able to do for themselves, he joined the Athenian
army and gave his life bravely in the defence of his country.
Can you think of any one who is more deserving of happiness?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” answered Crœsus, half choking with disappointment.
“But who do you think ranks next to Tellus
in happiness?” He was quite sure now that Solon would
say “Crœsus.”</p>

<p>“I have in mind,” said Solon, “two young men whom I
knew in Greece. Their father died when they were mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
children, and they were very poor. But they worked manfully
to keep the house together and to support their mother,
who was in feeble health. Year after year they toiled, nor
thought of anything but their mother’s comfort. When at
length she died, they gave all their love to Athens, their
native city, and nobly served her as long as they
lived.”</p>

<p>Then Crœsus was angry. “Why is it,” he asked, “that
you make me of no account and think that my wealth and
power are nothing? Why is it that you place these poor
working people above the richest king in the world?”</p>

<p>“O king,” said Solon, “no man can say whether you are
happy or not until you die. For no man knows what misfortunes
may overtake you, or what misery may be yours
in place of all this splendor.”</p>

<p>Many years after this there arose in Asia a powerful king
whose name was Cyrus. At the head of a great army he
marched from one country to another, overthrowing many
a kingdom and attaching it to his great empire of Babylon.
King Crœsus with all his wealth was not able to stand against
this mighty warrior. He resisted as long as he could.
Then his city was taken, his beautiful palace was burned,
his orchards and gardens were destroyed, his treasures were
carried away, and he himself was made prisoner.</p>

<p>“The stubbornness of this man Crœsus,” said King Cyrus,
“has caused us much trouble and the loss of many good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
soldiers. Take him and make an example of him for other
petty kings who may dare to stand in our way.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the soldiers seized Crœsus and dragged him
to the market-place, handling him roughly all the time.
Then they built up a great pile of dry sticks and timber taken
from the ruins of his once beautiful palace. When this was
finished, they tied the unhappy king in the midst of it, and
one ran for a torch to set it on fire.</p>

<p>“Now we shall have a merry blaze,” said the savage
fellows. “What good can all his wealth do him now?”</p>

<p>As poor Crœsus, bruised and bleeding, lay upon the pyre
without a friend to soothe his misery, he thought of the
words which Solon had spoken to him years before: “No
man can say whether you are happy or not until you die,”
and he moaned, “O Solon! O Solon! Solon!”</p>

<p>It so happened that Cyrus was riding by at that very
moment and heard his moans. “What does he say?” he
asked of the soldiers.</p>

<p>“He says, ‘Solon, Solon, Solon!’” answered one.</p>

<p>Then the king rode nearer and asked Crœsus, “Why do
you call on the name of Solon?”</p>

<p>Crœsus was silent at first; but after Cyrus had repeated
his question kindly, he told all about Solon’s visit at his
palace and what he had said.</p>

<p>The story affected Cyrus deeply. He thought of the
words, “No man knows what misfortunes may overtake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
you, or what misery may be yours in place of all this splendor.”
And he wondered if some time he, too, would lose all
his power and be helpless in the hands of his enemies.</p>

<p>“After all,” said he, “ought not men to be merciful and
kind to those who are in distress? I shall do to Crœsus
as I would have others do to me.” And he caused Crœsus
to be given his freedom; and ever afterwards treated him
as one of his most honored friends.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_CHRISTMAS_DINNER"></a>THE CHRISTMAS DINNER</h2>


<p>Up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit’s wife, dressed out but
poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,
which are cheap, and make a goodly show for sixpence;
and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, the
second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while
Master Peter Cratchit, who was wearing a monstrous shirt
collar belonging to his father, plunged a fork into the
saucepan of potatoes, and rejoiced to find himself so
gallantly attired.</p>

<p>And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came
tearing in, screaming that outside the baker’s they had
smelt the goose, and known it for their own. Then these
young Cratchits danced about the table, while Master
Peter Cratchit, whose collar nearly choked him, blew the
fire until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at
the saucepan lid to be let out and peeled.</p>

<p>“What has become of your father?” said Mrs. Cratchit.
“And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha wasn’t as
late last Christmas Day by half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Here’s Martha, Mother!” said a girl, appearing as
she spoke.</p>

<p>“Here’s Martha, Mother!” cried the two young Cratchits.
“Hurrah! There’s <i>such</i> a goose, Martha!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p139.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim</span></div>
</div>

<p>“Why, bless your heart, my dear, how late you are!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a><br /><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>”
said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking
off her shawl and bonnet for her.</p>

<p>“We had a great deal of work to finish up last night,”
replied the girl, “and had to clear away this morning,
Mother!”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind, as long as you are here,” said Mrs.
Cratchit. “Sit down before the fire, my dear, and warm
yourself.”</p>

<p>“No, no! There’s Father coming,” cried the two young
Cratchits, who were everywhere at once.</p>

<p>“Hide, Martha, hide!”</p>

<p>So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,
with at least three feet of comforter hanging down before
him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed,
and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he
bore a little crutch, and had his legs supported by an iron
frame!</p>

<p>“Why, where’s our Martha?” cried Bob Cratchit, looking
round.</p>

<p>“Not coming,” said Mrs. Cratchit.</p>

<p>“Not coming!” said Bob. “Not coming upon Christmas
Day!”</p>

<p>Martha didn’t like to see him disappointed, even if
it were only in joke; so she came out from behind the
closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young
Cratchits caught up Tiny Tim and carried him off into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the
kettle.</p>

<p>“And how did little Tim behave?” asked Mrs. Cratchit,
when Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart’s content.</p>

<p>“As good as gold,” said Bob, “and better. Somehow
he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks
the strangest things you ever heard. He told me that he
hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was
a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember
upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and
blind men see.”</p>

<p>Bob’s voice trembled when he told them this, and trembled
more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong
and hearty.</p>

<p>His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back
came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted
by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire. Then
Master Peter and the two young Cratchits went to bring
the goose, with which they soon returned in high glee.</p>

<p>Such excitement followed that you might have thought
a goose the rarest of all birds; and in truth it was something
very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the
gravy, ready beforehand in a little saucepan, hissing hot.
Master Peter mashed the potatoes; Miss Belinda sweetened
the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob
took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>The two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not
forgetting themselves. Then climbing into their chairs,
they held their fingers over their lips, lest they should call
for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the
dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was followed by
a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along
the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast. When
she did, and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued
forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board.
Even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat
on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried,
“Hurrah!”</p>

<p>There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t
believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness,
flavor, and size were wonderful to think of. With
apple sauce and mashed potatoes, it was enough dinner for
the whole family. Indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with
great delight, looking at one small bone upon the dish,
they hadn’t eaten all of it yet. But every one had had
enough, even the youngest Cratchits. But now, the
plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit
left the room to take the pudding up and bring it in.
Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should
break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have
climbed over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it,
while they were merry with the goose! The two young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
Cratchits almost went black in the face when they
thought of what might have happened.</p>

<p>Halloo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out
of the kettle. A smell like a washing-day. That was the
cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a baker’s next
door to each other, with a laundress’s next door to that!
That was the pudding. In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit
entered&mdash;flushed, but smiling proudly&mdash;with the pudding,
like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, and decked
with Christmas holly. Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob
Cratchit said it was the best pudding he had ever seen.
Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said
or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family.</p>

<p>At last the dinner was all done, the hearth swept, and
the fire made. All the Cratchit family drew round the
hearth, and watched the chestnuts on the fire as they
sputtered and cracked. Then Bob said, “Merry Christmas
to us all, my dears. God bless us!”</p>

<h2><a id="BERGETTAS_MISFORTUNE"></a>BERGETTA’S MISFORTUNE</h2>


<p>Old Bergetta lay asleep on the doorstep in the sun. Her
two little white fore paws were gathered in under her chin,
and she had encircled herself with her tail in the most compact
and comfortable way. Her three companion cats were
all out of her way at that moment. She forgot their existence.
She was only conscious of the kindly rays that sank
into her soft fur and made her so very sleepy and comfortable.</p>

<p>Presently a sound broke the stillness, very slight and far
off, but she heard it, and pricked up her pretty pink-lined
ears and listened intently. Two men, bearing a large
basket between them, came in sight, approaching the
house from the beach. The basket seemed heavy; the men
each held a handle of it, and very silently went with it
round to the back entrance of the house.</p>

<p>Bergetta settled her head once more upon her folded paws,
and tried to go to sleep again. But the thought of the basket
prevented. She got up, stretched herself, and lightly and
noiselessly made her way round the house to the back door
and went in. The basket stood in the middle of the floor,
and the three other cats sat at a respectful distance from it
near each other, surveying it doubtfully.</p>

<p>Bergetta wasn’t afraid; she went slowly towards it to
find out what it contained, but when quite close to it she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
became aware of a curious noise&mdash;a rustling, crunching,
dull, clashing sound which was as peculiar as alarming. She
stopped and listened; all the other cats listened. Suddenly
a queer object thrust itself up over the edge, and a most
extraordinary shape began to rise gradually into sight. Two
long, dark, slender feelers waved about aimlessly in the air
for a moment; two clumsy claws grasped the rim of the
basket, and by their help a hideous dark bottle-green-colored
body patched with vermilion, bristling with points and
knobs, and cased in hard, strong, jointed armor, with eight
legs flying in all directions, each fringed at the foot with
short yellowish hair, and with the inner edges of the huge
misshapen claws lined with a row of sharp, uneven teeth,
opening and shutting with the grasp of a vise,&mdash;this ugly
body rose into view before the eyes of the astonished cats.
It was a living lobster.</p>

<p>As the hard and horny monster raised itself out of the
basket, it fell with a loud noise all in a heap on the floor
before Bergetta. She drew back in alarm, and then sat
down at a safe distance to observe this strange creature.
The other cats also sat down to watch, farther off than Bergetta,
but quite as much interested.</p>

<p>For a long time all was still. The lobster, probably
rather shocked by its fall, lay just where it had dropped.
Inside the basket a faint stirring and wrestling and clashing
was heard from the other lobsters,&mdash;that was all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
Very soon Bergetta felt herself becoming extremely bored
with this state of things. She crept a little nearer the
basket.</p>

<p>“I needn’t be afraid of that thing,” thought she; “it
doesn’t move any more.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p148.jpg" alt="Cat with lobster" />
</div>


<p>Nearer and nearer she crept, the other cats watching her,
but not stirring. At last she reached the lobster, that in its
wrath and discomfort sat blowing a cloud of rainbow bubbles
from its mouth, but making no other movement. Bergetta
ventured to put out her paw and touch its hard shell. It
took no notice of this, though it saw Bergetta with its queer
eyes on stilts, which it wheeled about on all sides to see what
she was doing.</p>

<p>She tried another little pat, whereat the lobster waved its
long feelers, that streamed away over its back in the air,
far beyond its tail. That was charming! Bergetta was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
delighted. The monster was really playful! She gave him
another little pat with her soft paw, and then coquettishly
boxed his ears, or the place where his ears ought to be.
There was a movement of the curious shelly machinery
about his mouth, but he was yet too indifferent to mind
anything much.</p>

<p>Bergetta continued to tease him. This was fun! First
with the right and then with the left paw she gave him little
cuffs and pushes and pats which moved him no more than a
rock. At last he seemed to become aware that he was being
treated with somewhat more familiarity than was agreeable
from an entire stranger, and began to move his ponderous
front claws uneasily.</p>

<p>Still Bergetta continued to frisk about him, till he thrust
out his eight smaller claws with a gesture of displeasure, and
opened and shut the clumsy teeth of the larger ones in a way
that was quite dreadful to behold. “This is very funny,”
thought Bergetta. “I wonder what it means!” and she
pushed her little white paw directly between the teeth of the
larger claw which was opening and shutting slowly. Instantly
the two sides snapped together with a tremendous
grip, and Bergetta uttered a scream of pain,&mdash;her paw was
caught as in a vise and cut nearly through with the uneven
toothed edge.</p>

<p>Alas, alas! Here was a situation. In vain she tried to
get away; the lobster’s claw clasped her delicate paw in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
grasp altogether too close for comfort. Crying with fear
and distress, Bergetta danced about all over the room; and
everywhere Bergetta danced, the lobster was sure to go, too,
clinging for dear life; up and down, over and across, they
went in the wildest kind of a jig, while all the other cats made
themselves as small as they could in the remotest corners,
and watched the performance with mingled awe and consternation.
Such a noise! Bergetta crying and the lobster
clattering, and the two cutting such capers together! At
last some one heard the noise, and coming to the rescue
thrust a stick between the clumsy teeth and loosened the
grip of the merciless claw; and poor Bergetta, set at liberty,
limped off to console herself as best she might.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_INDIANS"></a>THE INDIANS</h2>


<p>When the people from the Old World first settled in this
country, they found a race here whom they called Indians.
This same race still inhabit this country, but they are few in
numbers as compared with the whites, and they live mostly
in the far West.</p>

<p>The Indians then did not dress like those you may see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
now, but their faces and figures have not changed very
much. They have a dark skin, straight, black hair, black
eyes, high cheek-bones, flat noses, white teeth, and wear no
beards. In stature they are tall and straight.</p>

<p>The houses in which the Indians lived were not at all like
our homes, and they were called huts or wigwams. These
wigwams were sometimes made of poles set in the ground in
a circle. But when a large hut was wanted, the poles were
planted in two long rows. The poles were bent over at the
top, then fastened together and all covered with bark.
Sometimes the poles were driven into the ground in such a
way that they met at the top. A hole was left for smoke
near the top, and the rest of the pole frame was covered with
bark on the outside and with skins on the inside.</p>

<p>The Indians had no furniture, not even beds, and every
one sat and slept on skins or on mats made from rushes by
the squaws. These mats and skins were kept upon the
ground, but each person had a place for his own.</p>

<p>The food of the Indians consisted of fish and game,
together with such fruits and nuts as they were able to pick
and gather, besides the corn for cakes. Potatoes and corn
are both natives of this country and were first used by the
Indians. For drinking purposes, water was commonly
used, but they made a great many drinks with berries,
leaves, and roots.</p>

<p>The faces of the Indians were frequently painted in many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
colors, and to make the paint last long, holes were sometimes
pricked into the skin by means of thorns. The painting
then was much like the tattooing done now in many
islands of the sea. Sometimes they tattooed in this way
nearly the whole of their bodies.</p>

<p>In the warm parts of the country they wore little in the
way of dress, often no more than a kind of short skirt
which did not reach to the knees; but they took great delight
in having large strings of beads round their necks,
besides birds’ claws, squirrels’ heads, and the like. Where
it was colder, bearskins were worn in winter, with the fur
left on the pelt. In summer lighter skins were chosen, and
sometimes the fur was taken off. Large garments were,
in the main, made from the skins of the otter, beaver, or
raccoon. The men had a sort of leather breeches which they
used when hunting, and they wore moccasins for shoes.</p>

<p>Feathers, sometimes in head-dresses, sometimes in garments,
were used by the Indians, to show degrees of honor
won in war. Bows and arrows were used by them for hunting,
and likewise for weapons to defend themselves. The
work of making bows and arrows must have taken a great
deal of time, for the arrow shafts were whittled out of wood,
and the arrow-heads were chipped out of flint and other
stones. They used spears with which to fish, as well as
hooks and lines.</p>

<p>The wood for their boats was obtained by burning down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
trees near the ground, and then burning off the branches
and tops. In this way they managed to get logs the right
length, and then they burned them out on one side, after
which they scraped out the charred parts with shells. These
made very strong boats. A lighter canoe was built of a
frame covered with bark.</p>

<p>In times of peace the Indians hunted and fished. Such
a thing as a store or market was not needed. Each family
had to catch all the fish or kill all the game that might be
required for its wants. The boys early learned the art of
fishing and hunting, and in summer they fished from the
shore or from a canoe. In winter they bored holes through
the ice and used a hook and line or a long spear. This
spear, at the pointed end, was shaped like a fish.</p>

<p>Many stories are told how these hunters and fishermen
by tricks took their game. Sometimes they would drive
a whole herd of deer or buffalo out upon a narrow neck of
land running far into the water, and then cut off all escape
by building a row of fires across the neck. In this way
they kept the herd together until they killed all they wanted.</p>

<p>The war-dance was a great thing among Indians, and
they thought the only way to get honor was by following
the war-path. Therefore many hours were spent in learning
war-dances and in being able to hit a small mark a great
way off with the bow and arrow. By the time an Indian
lad reached sixteen and was able to do these things well, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
was old enough to go to war and to help fight the battles
which so often took place among the tribes.</p>

<p>Hunting and fishing and going to war were, however, not
all the things that the Indians did. They had many sports
and games for children, and also many for those who were
grown up. They played ball on the grass, a game like hockey
with sticks on the ice, and lacrosse, which we have now
adopted as our national game.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Selected.</span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_CHOICE_OF_HERCULES"></a>THE CHOICE OF HERCULES</h2>


<p>One morning when Hercules was a fair-faced lad of twelve
years, he was sent out to do an errand which he disliked very
much. As he walked slowly along the road, his heart was
full of bitter thoughts; and he murmured because others no
better than himself were living in ease and pleasure, while
for him there was little but labor and pain. Thinking upon
these things, he came after a while to a place where two
roads met; and he stopped, not certain which one to take.</p>

<p>The road on his right was hilly and rough, and there was
no beauty in it or about it; but he saw that it led straight
towards the blue mountains in the far distance. The road
on his left was broad and smooth, with shade trees on either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
side, where sang thousands of beautiful birds; and it went
winding in and out, through groves and green meadows,
where bloomed countless flowers; but it ended in fog and
mist long before reaching the wonderful mountains of blue.</p>

<p>While the lad stood in doubt as to which way he should
go, he saw two women coming towards him, each by a different
road. The one who came down the flowery way reached
him first, and Hercules saw that she was beautiful as a
summer day. Her cheeks were red, her eyes sparkled,
her voice was like the music of morning.</p>

<p>“O noble youth,” she said, “this is the road which you
should choose. It will lead you into pleasant ways where
there is neither toil, nor hard study, nor drudgery of any
kind. Your ears shall always be delighted with sweet
sounds, and your eyes with things beautiful and gay; and
you need do nothing but play and enjoy the hours as they
pass.”</p>

<p>By this time the other fair woman had drawn near, and
she now spoke to the lad.</p>

<p>“If you take my road,” said she, “you will find that it is
rocky and rough, and that it climbs many a hill and descends
into many a valley and quagmire. The views which
you will sometimes get from the hilltops are grand and
glorious, while the deep valleys are dark and the uphill ways
are toilsome; but the road leads to the blue mountains of
endless fame, of which you can see faint glimpses, far away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
They cannot be reached without labor; there is nothing
worth having but must be won through toil. If you would
have fruits and flowers, you must plant and care for them;
if you would gain the love of your fellow-men, you must
love them and suffer for them; if you would be a man, you
must make yourself strong by the doing of manly deeds.”</p>

<p>Then the boy saw that this woman, although her face
seemed at first very plain, was as beautiful as the dawn,
or as the flowery fields after a summer rain.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Some call me Labor,” she answered; “but others know
me as Truth.”</p>

<p>“And what is your name?” he asked, turning to the first
lady.</p>

<p>“Some call me Pleasure,” said she, with a smile; “but I
choose to be known as the Joyous One.”</p>

<p>“And what can you promise me at the end if I go with
you?”</p>

<p>“I promise nothing at the end. What I give, I give at
the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Labor,” said Hercules, “I shall follow your road. I
want to be strong and manly and worthy of the love of
my fellows. And whether I shall ever reach the blue mountains
or not, I want to have the reward of knowing that my
journey has not been without some worthy aim.”</p>

<h2><a id="THE_FROG_TRAVELLERS"></a>THE FROG TRAVELLERS</h2>


<p>Long, long ago, before the white man came across the
Sea of Peace to Japan, before the screaming engines frightened
the white heron from the rice fields, and before the
sparrows perched on telegraph wires, there lived two frogs,
one in a well at Kioto, the other in a pond at Ozaka.</p>

<p>In the land of Japan there is a proverb that “the frog in
the well knows not the great ocean.” The Kioto frog had
heard this said many times by the maids who came to draw
water, and one day he became vexed at their laughter.</p>

<p>“I shall stay here no longer,” he said to himself. “I
shall go at once to see this great ocean of which they talk.
I do not believe it is half as wide or as deep as my well,
where I can see the stars even in the daytime, but I shall
at least know what it looks like.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Frog told his family that he was going on a
journey, going out to Ozaka to see the great ocean. So
Mrs. Frog gave him a package of boiled rice and snails, and
tying it round his neck, he set off on his journey. When he
came out of the well, he saw that the other animals did not
leap, but walked upright on their legs. He thought he must
walk in the same way, so he stood up on his hind legs and
waddled off slowly across the fields.</p>

<p>On this very same day the frog who lived in the pond
decided to see more of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p166.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Well at Kioto</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>“Good-by,” he said to Mrs. Frog, as he jumped from a
lily-pad into the grass, “I am tired of sitting here in the
sun thinking and blinking, so I am going to Kioto.”</p>

<p>It so happened that the Kioto frog and the frog from
Ozaka met on a hill halfway between the two cities.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said one, bowing his head to the ground
three times.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said the other, also bowing respectfully.</p>

<p>Then they sank down in a shady spot, for they were very
tired and lame from trying to walk on their hind feet.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked the Ozaka frog. “This
is a fine day for a journey.”</p>

<p>“I set out to see the great ocean at Ozaka, of which I
have heard so often,” replied the frog who lived in the well,
“but I am so tired that I think I shall be satisfied with looking
at it from the top of this hill.”</p>

<p>“I am going to Kioto,” said the other frog.</p>

<p>“It is a long journey, my friend,” said the Kioto frog.
“Why do you not look at it from this hill and save yourself
the trouble of walking all the way?”</p>

<p>“That is a good plan, friend,” said the frog from Ozaka.</p>

<p>Then the two frogs climbed to the top of a flat rock,
and stood up on their hind legs, the Kioto frog facing the
great ocean at Ozaka, and the other facing the city of
Kioto. A frog’s eyes, as you know very well, are so placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
that when he sits comfortably at home on his lily-pad, he
looks before him. But when he stands on his hind legs
with his head in the air, he sees only what is behind him.
Standing in this way, on
top of the rock, the frogs
looked long and steadily
at the landscape. At last,
being very tired, they sat
down again.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/p168.jpg" alt="Two frogs standing talking" />
</div>

<p>“Ozaka looks exactly like
my home,” said the Kioto
frog; “and as for the ocean,
I saw nothing larger than
the brook I swam across this morning.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said the other. “Kioto looks just like
Ozaka. They are as much alike as two grains of rice. I
am glad that I met you, for you have saved me much trouble.
I shall return to my pond at once. Good-by, my friend.”</p>

<p>Then the two frogs jumped to the ground and hurried
off, leaping as a frog should do, and thus reaching home in a
short time. That night they told their friends about their
adventures, and still the frog in the pond thinks he has seen
the great world, and “the frog in the well knows not the
great ocean.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Elliot Griffis.</span></p>

<h2><a id="HOW_THE_INDIAN_KNEW"></a>HOW THE INDIAN KNEW</h2>


<p>One day an Indian came back from a trip to his traps, and
noticed, when he reached his wigwam, that a deer that had
hung inside had been stolen. He at once set to work to
find the thief.</p>

<p>Following the trail left by the evil-doer, the Indian soon
met a party of white men. He asked if they had seen a
little old man, lame and white, who had a short gun. The
Indian added that the man he was seeking was followed by
a small bobtailed dog, and that he carried a deer. Such a
man, he said, had stolen the deer from his wigwam.</p>

<p>“Why did you not seize the thief when you saw him?”
said they.</p>

<p>“I did not see him,” answered the Indian.</p>

<p>“How, then, do you know that he is little, and old, and
lame, and white, and has a short gun, and is followed by a
little bobtailed dog?” asked they.</p>

<p>“I know that he is short,” replied the Indian, “because
he piled up stones to stand on when he took down the meat.
He must be old, because his steps are short, as is shown by
his tracks. His gun, I know, is short, for I found the place
where he had leaned it against a sapling while he was taking
down the deer, and the muzzle left a scratch on the bark
near the ground. The dog, sitting down in the sand, left
the print of a stumpy tail. I knew the man was white by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the tracks of his boots, for Indians wear moccasins, and
do not turn out their toes when walking; and I knew that
he was lame, because the steps of the left foot were shorter
than those of the right, as was shown by the footprints.”</p>

<p>And the Indian passed on in pursuit of the one who had
robbed him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Selected.</span></p>

<h2><a id="SHOEING"></a>SHOEING</h2>


<p>At the blacksmith’s shop the bay mare Betty is being
fitted to new shoes. Already the fore feet are nicely shod
and the blacksmith now has the near hind foot in hand.
The other occupants of the place are a small donkey and the
bloodhound Laura.</p>

<p>Betty is a sensible horse and enjoys the shoeing process.
When the time comes around for her regular visit to the
forge, she walks off voluntarily and unattended to the
familiar spot. No halter is necessary to keep her standing;
in fact, she would not tolerate such an indignity. She
takes her place by the window as if perfectly at home.</p>

<p>Blacksmith and horse are old friends who understand
each other well. The man has won the animal’s confidence
by the care he has taken to fit the shoes comfortably.
Though a plain, rough fellow, he is of a kindly nature and
knows his business thoroughly. The shop is a quaint little
place such as one finds in English villages. The thick masonry
of the walls shows how old the building is; the floor
is paved with large blocks of stone. Between the anvil and
the forge there is only space enough for the horse to stand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p176.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Landseer  <span class="smcap">Shoeing</span></div>
</div>

<p>At the stage of the process seen in the picture the preparations
are all over. The old shoes were first removed and
the feet pared and filed. New shoes were chosen as near the
right size as possible, and one by one shaped for each foot.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a><br /><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
And now, holding the shoe in his long tongs, the blacksmith
thrusts it into the fire, while he fans the flames with the
bellows. Thence it is transferred, a glowing red crescent, to
the anvil. Now the workman swings his hammer upon it
with ringing strokes, the sparks fly out in a shower, and the
soft metal is shaped at will. The shoe may be made a little
broader or a little longer, as the case may be; bent a trifle
here or there, to accommodate the foot to be fitted. The
steel toe calk is welded in, the ends are bent to form the
heels, the holes for nails are punctured, the shoe taking an
occasional plunge into the flames during these processes.</p>

<p>Now there must be a preliminary trying-on. The shoe,
still hot, is held to the foot for which it is intended, and the
air is filled with the fumes of burning hoof. Yet the horse
does not flinch, for the thick hoof is a perfect protection for
the sensitive parts of the foot. If the careful blacksmith is
not quite satisfied with the fit, there must be more hammering
on the anvil, and another trying-on. When the shoe is
satisfactory, it is thrust hissing into a barrel of cold water,
and, when cooled and hardened, is ready to be nailed on.</p>

<p>It is at this point in the story that we come upon Betty.
The blacksmith, after the approved method of his trade,
holds the foot firmly between his knees, and bends to his
task. The nails, long and flat, are in the tool-box on the
floor beside him. A few firm blows of the hammer drive
each one into place, first on one side, then on the other;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the projecting points are twisted off every time, and finally
all the rough ends are filed smoothly on the outside of the
hoof. Betty is at last fully shod and will step complacently
home.</p>

<p>The painter, Sir Edwin Landseer, has arranged the four
figures of the picture in such a way that we may see each one
in a characteristic pose. The bay mare is, of course, the chief
attraction,&mdash;a fine high-bred creature, with straight legs,
arching neck, and gentle face, marked on the forehead with
a pure white star. Landseer exerted his utmost skill in
reproducing the texture of the glossy hide. Its beautiful
sheen is more striking by contrast with the shaggy hair of
the donkey. It was a clever thought to place this plebeian
little beast beside the aristocratic, high-spirited horse.</p>

<p>The donkey bends his head in a deprecating way below
Betty’s handsome neck, and the horse permits the companionship
of an inferior with gentle tolerance. There is something
very appealing about the donkey, a patient little beast
of burden, meekly bearing his saddle. The bloodhound
shows no little curiosity as to the shoeing process, as if it
were something new to her. She sits on her haunches,
thrusting her head forward, the long ears drooping, the
sensitive nose sniffing the strange odors.</p>

<p>Among these dumb companions the blacksmith feels
himself surrounded by friends. He is a lover of pets, as we
see by the bird-cage hanging in the window. His sturdy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
frame looks equal to the demands of his trade, which are,
in fact, very onerous. It is grimy work, and only the
roughest clothes can be worn. A big leather apron with a
cut down the middle is, as it were, his badge of office. He
does his work with conscientious earnestness, concentrating
all his thought and energy upon each blow of the hammer.
The task completed, he will take an honest pride in the
good piece of work he has done for Betty.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_SEARCH_FOR_A_WESTERN_SEA"></a>THE SEARCH FOR A WESTERN SEA</h2>


<p>Two hundred years ago the great country lying between
Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains was unknown to
the people who lived in the little stockaded forts, where
Quebec, Montreal, and Three Rivers now stand. Great
explorers had followed Columbus to America, and had sailed
down the mighty St. Lawrence and its tributaries. They
all longed to find the Great Western Sea, which Columbus
had hoped would lead to Asia; but over two hundred years
had passed since his voyage, and no one had yet reached
the great water of the West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>When Pierre de la Vérendrye was a boy, living at Three
Rivers, he heard many wonderful stories of adventure told
by fur traders and explorers as they returned from expeditions
to the North and West, and he longed for the time
to come when he would be old enough to join such a party.
When he was twenty-seven years old, he had charge of a
trading-post on Lake Nepigon, and heard from the neighboring
Indians of great lakes and rivers, and immense tracts
of treeless country where herds of cattle roamed. He had
not forgotten the dream of his boyhood, and when these
tales of a land far west reached him, he made up his mind
that he would be the one to explore the country and find
a way to the Western Sea.</p>

<p>Years passed by, and it was not until 1731 that his dream
was realized. He had spent years in preparing for the expedition.
The governor at Quebec had given him a license
to trade with the Indians, and Montreal merchants promised
to supply him with money and goods. On the eighth day of
June the company set out from Montreal. It consisted
of Vérendrye, his three tall sons, Jean, Pierre and François,
and fifty followers. There were the priests, the hardy
voyageurs, the wood runners, and the Indian interpreters.
They embarked in birch canoes measuring from eighty to
ninety feet in length. In the bottom of the canoes were
strongly wrapped packages of merchandise which were to be
exchanged on the way for furs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<p>In seventy-eight days they reached Kaministiquia, a fur
post on Lake Superior, where Fort William now stands.
This was the last Western post. All the country beyond
this would be new to the eager voyageurs. Sailing down
the Pigeon River, they entered Rainy Lake and built Fort
St. Pierre on its left bank. Winter was approaching and
their supply of provisions was getting low, so it was necessary
for some of the party to return to the nearest trading-post
to obtain provisions and goods in exchange for valuable
furs. The Cree Indians who inhabited this district had
gazed in wonder at the presents of ammunition offered to
them by the white men, and had gladly given generous
supplies of furs in exchange for these new possessions.</p>

<p>When spring came, the voyageurs accepted the friendly
offer of the Indians to guide them west to the Lake of the
Woods. It was several months before the next long stop
was made. They had reached the head of the lake when it
was again necessary to stop and build a fort for their winter
stay. This fort, built of logs, chinked up with clay and
moss, and roofed with branches of trees, was called St.
Charles.</p>

<p>The next year they reached Lake Winnipeg by way of
the Winnipeg River, and near its mouth they built Fort
Maurepas, now known as Fort Alexander. In 1738, after
travelling over many miles of the surrounding country,
Vérendrye left this fort, crossed the southern end of Lake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Winnipeg, and entered the Red River, which he followed
until he came to its junction with the Assiniboine, and to
the place where the city of Winnipeg now stands. The
land around the river was dotted with the tepees of the
Assiniboine Indians, who probably now looked upon a
white man for the first time. A rude fort called Fort Rouge
was built, and leaving his sons to trade with the Indians,
Vérendrye pushed on up the Assiniboine and in one week
came to the “Portage of the Prairie.” This was called by
the explorer, Fort De La Reine.</p>

<p>Vérendrye had now spent seven years in his search for the
Western Sea. He had suffered many hardships. His men
had often mutinied and deserted him. Winter had overtaken
him when supplies were low, and in these times of
famine he and his men had lived on roots and bark, coarse
parchment, and often on the flesh of the sleigh dogs. His
eldest son, Jean, had been cruelly murdered by the Indians,
while he was journeying to one of the eastern forts for
supplies. Still the brave explorer’s courage did not fail, and
he pressed on hoping to find some sign, or hear some word
that would tell him his quest had not been in vain.</p>

<p>The merchants at Montreal upon whom Vérendrye depended
for aid were not interested in his work of exploration,
but cared only for the loads of valuable furs which he
sent to them. Fur traders were jealous of his success, and
charged him with trading for his own profit, and deceiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
his partners. Leaving his sons to continue their explorations,
he returned to Quebec in 1746 to defend himself
against these false charges.</p>

<p>Nothing could be proved against him, but this was small
comfort to the worn-out traveller. His life had been one of
suffering and disappointment, and his countrymen did not
realize the noble work he had done, yet he was eager to
return to his sons and continue the work he had begun.
In 1749 he was preparing for the journey back to the West,
when he was taken ill, and died suddenly at Montreal.
Though his work was not appreciated during his lifetime, he
is now honored as the pioneer explorer of the Great West.</p>

<h2><a id="DICK_WHITTINGTON"></a>DICK WHITTINGTON</h2>


<p>Many years ago in an English village there lived a boy
whose name was Dick Whittington. His father and mother
died when he was so young that he did not remember them
at all. He had no home, and was a ragged little fellow
running about the streets of the little village.</p>

<p>Now the place where Dick lived was not very far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
London, and the people liked to talk about the great city.
None of them had ever been to London, but they seemed to
know all about the wonderful things that were to be seen
there. Dick listened to their stories and longed to see for
himself. One day a large wagon drawn by eight fine horses
with bells on their heads was driven into the little town.
When Dick saw this wagon he thought that it must be going
to the city, and he asked the driver to let him go with him.
When the driver learned that Dick was very poor, and that
he had neither father nor mother, he told the lad that he
might walk by the side of the wagon if he wished.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/p188.jpg" alt="Dick Whittington sitting by roadside" />
</div>

<p>It was a long
walk for the little
fellow, but at last
they came to London.
Dick was in
a great hurry to
see the wonderful
sights of the city.
He thanked the
driver of the wagon
and ran from one street to another. At last it began
to grow dark, and in every street there was only dirt instead
of gold. Nowhere could he find the golden pavements
that he had heard so much about. He sat down in a dark
corner and cried himself to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>In the morning he woke up very hungry, but there was
not even a crust of bread for him to eat. He thought
now only of food, and asked every one he met to give him
a penny to buy something to eat. Nobody stopped to
speak to him, and the poor boy grew weak for want of food.
At last he grew so faint and tired that he could go no farther.
He sat down on the steps of a fine house to rest, and
wished that he were back again in the little village where
he was born.</p>

<p>Just at that time the owner of the house came home to
dinner, and saw the ragged little fellow asleep on the steps.</p>

<p>“My lad, what are you doing here? Wake up, my boy.
Why don’t you go to work?”</p>

<p>“I should like to work if I could find anything to do,”
said Dick, “but I don’t know where to look for work. I
have not had anything to eat for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Poor little fellow! Come with me, and I shall see what
I can do for you.” The kind merchant took Dick into
the house, where he was given a good dinner, and put to
work in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Dick would have lived very happily in this new home
if the old cook had not been so cross. She found fault with
him, and scolded him from morning till night. But at
last little Alice, his master’s daughter, heard how the poor
little kitchen boy was treated, and she asked the cook to be
kind to the lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>From this time Dick was not treated so unkindly, and
he would have been quite happy if it had not been
for another trouble. His bed was in a garret at the
top of the house, far away from other people. The
floor was full of holes, and every night rats and mice kept
him awake by running over his face. They tormented him
so much that he tried to think of some way to get rid
of them.</p>

<p>One day a gentleman gave him a penny for cleaning his
shoes. Dick thought a long time about the best way to
spend it. At last he made up his mind that he would buy
a cat with the money. The very next day he went out
into the street and saw a girl carrying a cat in her arms.</p>

<p>“I will give you a penny for your cat,” said Dick. “Will
you take it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the girl, “you may have her for a penny.
She is worth more than that, for she knows how to catch
rats and mice.”</p>

<p>So Dick bought the cat, and took her to the garret.
Every day he carried a part of his dinner to her, and it was
not long before she had driven all the rats and mice away.
Then the little fellow could sleep soundly every night.</p>

<p>Soon after this a ship belonging to Dick’s master was about
to start on a voyage across the sea. It was loaded with
goods which were to be sold in other lands far away. The
master called his servants together and asked if they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
anything they would like to send out in the ship for trade.
He wanted to give his servants a chance for a good fortune,
too. Every one had something to send out in the ship&mdash;every
one but Dick. As he had neither money nor goods,
he did not meet with the others.</p>

<p>But Alice, the merchant’s daughter, guessed why Dick
did not come in with the rest of the servants, and sent for
him. When the boy came into the room the merchant said,
“Well, Dick, what are you going to send out on the ship?”</p>

<p>“I have nothing in the world,” Dick answered, “but a
cat which I bought some time ago for a penny. But I
should not like to part with her.”</p>

<p>“Go, and get your cat, my lad. We shall send her out
on the ship. She may bring you some profit,&mdash;who
knows?”</p>

<p>With tears in his eyes poor Dick carried puss down to
the ship and gave her to the captain. Everybody laughed
at the boy for sending off a cat to be sold. But little Alice
felt sorry for him and gave him some money to buy
another cat.</p>

<p>After this the old cook used him more cruelly than ever.
She was always either scolding him, or making fun of him
for sending his cat to sea. At last Dick could not bear her
abuse any longer, and made up his mind to go back to his
old home. So he packed up his few possessions and very
early one morning started off. After walking some distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
he sat down on a stone which to this day is called “Whittington’s
Stone.” While he sat there, wondering what it
was best for him to do, the church bells began to ring. As
he listened they seemed to say to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Turn again, Whittington,</div>
  <div class="verse">Thrice Lord Mayor of London.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Lord Mayor of London!” said Dick to himself. “Well,
well, I would put up with almost anything to be Lord Mayor
of London. I shall return and let the old cook scold and
cuff me as much as she pleases.” He hurried back to the
merchant’s house and was lucky to get into the kitchen
before the old cook came downstairs. In fact, she never
knew that he had been away.</p>

<p>The ship with the cat on board was a long time at sea.
It was at last driven by the winds to a strange land where
the people had never seen any white men before. They
came in crowds to visit the ship, and to buy the fine things
with which it was loaded.</p>

<p>It was not long before the king of the country invited the
captain to visit him. When the captain reached the king’s
palace he was shown into a beautiful room, and given a seat
on rich carpets embroidered with gold and silver thread.
The king and queen were seated not far away, and soon
many fine dishes filled with good things to eat were set before
them. They had hardly begun to eat when a great many
rats and mice rushed into the room and ate everything that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
was in the dishes. The captain wondered greatly at this,
and asked the king, “Why do you let the rats come into the
palace in this way?”</p>

<p>“I cannot keep them out,” the king replied. “I would
give half of my treasure if I could get rid of them.”</p>

<p>The captain jumped for joy, for he remembered Dick
Whittington’s cat. “I have a wonderful animal on board
the ship which will kill all your rats and mice,” he said.</p>

<p>“Bring the creature to me,” said the king. “If she will
do what you say, I shall load your ship with gold.”</p>

<p>Away went the captain down to the ship to get the cat,
while the king and queen had another dinner made ready.
The captain with the cat in his arms reached the palace just
as the guests were about to be served. In rushed the rats
and mice. As soon as the cat saw them she jumped from
the captain’s arms, and in a few minutes killed many of
them. The rest scampered away in fright and did not dare
to come back again.</p>

<p>The king and queen were delighted, and wished to own the
wonderful creature that had done them so great a service.
The king at once made a bargain with the captain for all
the goods on board the ship, and then gave for the cat ten
times as much money as he had given for everything else
on the ship.</p>

<p>The captain then bade the king and queen good-by, and
set sail for England. The good ship was soon safe at home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
and the honest captain hastened to see its owner. He
quickly told the story of the cat, and showed all the gold
that the king and queen had sent to poor Dick in payment
for her. As soon as the merchant heard this, he called to one
of his servants and said, “Send for Dick. And pray call
him Mr. Whittington.”</p>

<p>The servant found Dick scouring pots and kettles in the
kitchen. When the lad came in, the merchant told him
how the captain had sold his cat and brought in return
great riches. Then he opened the box and showed Dick
his treasure. “All
this is yours,” said
the merchant.
“Your riches are
now far greater
than mine, and I
wish you may long
enjoy them.”</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/p194.jpg" alt="Nobleman with two attendants (relevance unclear)" />
</div>

<p>Poor Dick was so
happy that he did
not know what to
say or do. He
begged his master
to take part of his
treasure, but the
good man refused. Dick then offered some of the jewels to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
his mistress, and he also asked Alice to accept a portion of
them. They told him how happy they were because of his
good fortune, and that he must keep it all for his own. But
the boy was too kind-hearted to keep everything for himself.
He made a present to the captain and the sailors, and to
each of his master’s servants, even to the cross old cook.</p>

<p>After a few years had passed there was a fine wedding
at one of the finest churches in London, and Miss Alice
became the wife of Mr. Richard Whittington. They lived
in great splendor and were very happy. Far and near they
were known and loved for their kind deeds.</p>

<p>So it was not long before Richard Whittington became
one of the foremost men in London, and in good time he
was thrice Lord Mayor of the great city.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Selected.</span></p>

<h2><a id="BLACK_BEAUTYS_BREAKING_IN"></a>BLACK BEAUTY’S BREAKING IN</h2>


<p>I was now beginning to grow handsome; my coat had
grown fine and soft, and was bright black. I had one white
foot, and a pretty white star on my forehead. I was
thought very handsome. My master would not sell me until
I was four years old; he said lads ought not to work like men,
and colts ought not to work like horses, until they were
grown up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p199.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thoroughbreds</span></div>
</div>

<p>When I was four years old, Squire Gordon came to look
at me. He examined my eyes, my mouth, and my legs;
he felt them all down, and then I had to walk and trot and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a><br /><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
gallop before him. He seemed to like me, and said, “When
he has been well broken in, he will do very well.” My
master said he would break me in himself, as he should not
like me to be frightened or hurt; and he lost no time about
it, for the next day he began.</p>

<p>Every one may not know what breaking in is, therefore
I shall describe it. It means to teach a horse to wear a
saddle and bridle, and to carry on his back a man, woman,
or child; to go just the way his rider wishes, and to go quietly.
Besides this, he has to learn to wear a collar, a crupper, and
a breeching, and to stand still whilst they are put on; then
to have a cart or a wagon fixed behind him, so that he cannot
walk or trot without dragging it after him; and he
must go fast or slow, just as his driver wishes. He must
never start at what he sees, nor speak to other horses, nor
bite, nor kick, nor have any will of his own, but always do
his master’s will, even though he may be very tired or hungry.
But the worst of all is when his harness is once on,
he may neither jump for joy nor lie down for weariness. So
you see this breaking in is a great thing.</p>

<p>I had, of course, long been used to the halter and the
headstall, and to be led about in the fields and lanes quietly;
but now I was to have a bit and bridle. My master gave me
some oats, as usual, and, after a great deal of coaxing, he
got the bit into my mouth, and the bridle fixed; but it was
a nasty thing!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot
think how bad it feels&mdash;a great piece of cold, hard steel
as thick as a man’s finger to be pushed into one’s mouth,
between one’s teeth and over one’s tongue, with the ends
coming out at the corner of one’s mouth, and held fast there
by straps over one’s head, under one’s throat, round one’s
nose, and under one’s chin, so that no way in the world can
one get rid of the nasty, hard thing. It is very bad; yes,
very bad! at least I thought so; but I knew my mother
always wore one when she went out, and all horses did when
they were grown up. And so, what with the nice oats,
and what with my master’s pats, kind words, and gentle
ways, I got to wear my bit and bridle.</p>

<p>Next came the saddle; but that was not half so bad. My
master put it on my back very gently, whilst the old workman
held my head. He then made the girths fast under
my body, patting and talking to me all the time. Then I
had a few oats, then a little leading about; and this he did
every day, until I began to look for the oats and the saddle.
At length, one morning, my master got on my back, and rode
me round the meadow on the soft grass. It certainly did
feel queer; but I must say I felt rather proud to carry my
master, and, as he continued to ride me a little every day,
I soon became accustomed to it.</p>

<p>The next unpleasant business was putting on the iron
shoes. My master went with me to the smith’s forge to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
see that I was not hurt. The blacksmith took my feet in
his hand, one after the other, and cut away some of the
hoof. It did not pain me, and so I stood still on three legs
until he had done them all. Then he took a piece of iron
the shape of my foot and clapped it on, and drove some
nails through the shoe quite into my hoof, so that the shoe
was firmly on. My feet felt very stiff and heavy, but in
time I became used to it.</p>

<p>And now, having come so far, my master went on to break
me to harness; there were more new things to wear. First,
a stiff, heavy collar just on my neck, and a bridle with great
side pieces against my eyes, called blinkers; and blinkers
indeed they were, for I could not see on either side, but only
straight in front of me. Next, there was a small saddle with
an ugly, stiff strap that went right under my tail; that was
the crupper. I hated the crupper; to have my long tail
doubled up and poked through that strap was almost as
bad as the bit. I never felt more like kicking; but of
course I could not kick such a good master. And so in
time I became used to everything, and could do my work
as well as my mother.</p>

<p>I must not forget to mention one part of my training,
which I have always considered a very great advantage.
My master sent me for a fortnight to a neighboring farmer’s,
who had a meadow which was skirted on one side by the
railway. Here were some sheep and cows, and I was turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
in amongst them. I shall never forget the first train that
ran by. I was feeding quietly near the fence which separated
the meadow from the railway, when I heard a strange
sound at a distance. And before I knew whence it came,
with a rush and a clatter, and a puffing out of smoke, a long
black train of something flew by, and was gone almost before
I could draw my breath. I turned, and galloped to the
other side of the meadow as fast as I could go, and there I
stood snorting with astonishment and fear.</p>

<p>In the course of the day many other trains went by,
some more slowly; these drew up at the station close by,
and sometimes made an awful whistle and groan before
they stopped. I thought it very dreadful; but the cows
went on eating very quietly, and hardly raised their heads
as the black, dreadful thing came puffing and groaning
past.</p>

<p>For the first few days I could not feed in peace; but as
I found that this terrible creature never came into the field,
or did me any harm, I began to disregard it, and very soon
I cared as little about the passing of a train as the cows and
sheep did. Since then, I have seen many horses much
alarmed and restive at the sight or sound of a steam-engine;
but, thanks to my good master’s care, I am as fearless at
railway stations as in my own stable.</p>

<p>Now, if any one wants to break in a young horse well,
that is the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>My master often drove me in double harness with my
mother, because she was steady, and could teach me how
to go better than a strange horse. She told me that the
better I behaved, the better I should be treated, and that
it was wisest always to do my best to please my master.</p>

<p>“But,” said she, “there are a great many kinds of men.
There are good, thoughtful men, like our master, that any
horse may be proud to serve; but there are bad, cruel men,
who never ought to have a horse or dog to call their own.
Besides, there are a great many foolish men, vain, ignorant,
and careless, who never trouble themselves to think. These
spoil more horses than all, just for want of sense; they do
not mean it, but they do it for all that. I hope you will fall
into good hands; but a horse never knows who may buy
him, or who may drive him: it is all a chance for us; but
still I say, do your best wherever it is, and keep up your good
name.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Anna Sewell.</span></p>

<h2><a id="A_SOUND_OPINION"></a>A SOUND OPINION</h2>


<p>One day a farmer, named Bernard, having finished
his business at the market town, found that he had
a few hours at his disposal before returning home. He
had often heard people speaking about a certain Mr.
Wiseman, a lawyer, whose reputation was so great
that even the judges did not like to decide contrary
to his opinion. Bernard thought he might spend some
of his time in getting an opinion from so learned and
clever a lawyer.</p>

<p>When he arrived at Mr. Wiseman’s office, he had to wait a
long time, but at last his turn came and he was shown into
the room. Mr. Wiseman asked him to sit down, and after
taking a good look at him through his spectacles, asked him
to state his business.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Mr. Lawyer,” said the farmer, twisting
his hat in his hand, “I can’t say I have any particular business
with you; but as I happened to be in town, to-day,
I thought I should be losing an opportunity if I did not get
an opinion from you.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for your confidence in me,” replied the
lawyer. “You have, I suppose, some law-suit going on?”</p>

<p>“A law-suit?” said the farmer; “I should rather think
not! There is nothing I hate so much, and I have never
had a quarrel with any one in my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>

<p>“Then, I suppose, you want some family property fairly
and justly divided?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir; my family lives with me in peace,
and we have no need to think of dividing our property.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, then, you want some agreement drawn up
about the sale or purchase of something?”</p>

<p>“Not at all! I am not rich enough to be purchasing
property, and not poor enough to wish to sell any.”</p>

<p>“Then what on earth do you want me to do, my friend?”
said the astonished lawyer.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Wiseman, I thought I had already told you
that,” replied Bernard, with a sheepish laugh; “what I
want is an opinion. I am ready to pay for it. You see,
here I am in town, and it would be a great pity if I were to
lose the opportunity.”</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at him and smiled; then taking up his
pen, he asked the farmer what his name was. “Peter
Bernard,” said he, quite pleased that the lawyer at last
understood what he wanted.</p>

<p>“Your age?”</p>

<p>“Forty years, or somewhere about that.”</p>

<p>“Your profession?”</p>

<p>“My profession! Ah, yes! you mean what do I do? I
am a farmer.”</p>

<p>The lawyer, still smiling, wrote two lines on a piece of
paper, folded it up, and gave it to his strange client.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>“Is that all,” cried Bernard; “well, well! so much the
better. I daresay you are too busy to write much. Now,
how much does that cost, Mr. Lawyer?”</p>

<p>“Half-a-crown.”</p>

<p>Bernard paid the money, made his bow, and went away
delighted that he had got an opinion.</p>

<p>When he reached home it was four in the afternoon; he
was tired with his journey, and made up his mind to have
a good rest. It happened, however, that his hay had been
cut for some days, and was now completely dry; and one
of his men came to ask if it should be carried in and housed
that night.</p>

<p>“This night!” said the farmer’s wife. “Who ever heard
of such a thing? Your master is tired, and the hay can just
as well be got in to-morrow.” The man said it was no
business of his, but the weather might change, and the
horses and carts were ready, and the farm hands had nothing
to do. To this the angry wife replied that the wind was
in a favorable quarter, and that they could not any way get
the work done before nightfall.</p>

<p>Bernard, having listened to both sides of the question,
hesitated to decide, when suddenly he remembered the
paper the lawyer had given him. “Stop a minute!” cried
he, “I have an opinion&mdash;a famous opinion&mdash;an opinion
that cost me half-a-crown. That’s the thing to put us
straight. You are a grand scholar, my dear; tell us what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
it says.” His wife took the paper, and with some little
difficulty, read out these two lines:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Peter Bernard: Never put off till to-morrow what you can
do to-day.</i></p>

<p>“There’s the very thing!” cried the farmer. “Quick!
out with the men and the carts, and we’ll have the hay in at
once!”</p>

<p>His wife still grumbled, but it was of no use. Bernard was
obstinate. He declared that he was not going to pay half-a-crown
for nothing, and that, as he had an opinion from his
lawyer, he would follow it whatever happened. In fact, he
set the example himself, and urging his men to the greatest
speed, did not return to his home till all the hay was safely
housed.</p>

<p>During the night the weather suddenly changed. An
unforeseen storm burst over the valley. In the morning a
stream flowed through the meadows carrying in its current
the newly cut hay of all the neighbors. Bernard alone
saved his.</p>

<p>From that day forward he followed the lawyer’s advice,
and in course of time became one of the richest farmers in
the district. Nor did he forget that he owed his success to
the lawyer, to whom he carried every year a couple of fat
fowls.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Selected.</span></p>

down the driveway and looked through the bars of the gate
to see who was passing. It was a large white gate of strong
wood, lovely to swing on, if by chance it was left unfastened.
It would shut of itself, and you had only to push it open,
jump on, and ride all the way back, while the gate swung
into place.</p>

<p>On the great day when Hugh John became a soldier, he
had been digging all the morning in the sand hole. He
had on his red coat, which was his pride, and he was taking
a fort protected by high walls of sand. He shouted
“Boom!” when he fired off his cannon, and “Bang,
whack!” when he knocked down the walls that he had
so carefully patted into shape.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a sound which always made the
heart of Hugh John beat fast. It was the sound of the drum.
He had only time to make a dash for his soldier’s cap, gird
on his sword with the gold hilt, and fly. As he ran down
the driveway, the sound of the fifes grew louder and louder.
It was at this point that Hugh John had a great struggle
with himself. His brother and sister were playing under
an elm tree on the front lawn. He could not bear
that they should miss the soldiers. But then, if
he went back, the troops might be past before he
reached the gate.</p>

<p>“I must see the soldiers. I must&mdash;I must!” he cried.</p>

<p>But in his heart a little voice kept saying, “It is mean
to go off without telling your brother and sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>“I can’t be mean! I won’t be mean!” thought Hugh
John. And so he ran back with all his might, and with a
warning cry called the younger children to follow. Then
with legs that passed each other so quickly that they could
hardly be seen, Hugh John fairly flung himself towards the
white gate. The gate was open, and with a wild cry he
sprang through and stood on the roadside just as the troops
came into view.</p>

<p>The first who passed were soldiers in a dark uniform.
No one cast a glance at Hugh John. He stood with his
drawn sword, giving the salute as each company went by.
Then came red coats and brass bands. Hugh John saluted
them all. No one paid the least attention to him. He did
not, indeed, expect any one to notice him. He was only a
small dusty boy with a sword too big for him,
standing under the shadow of the elms. But he saluted
every one of them as they swung past, dust-choked and
thirsty.</p>

<p>At last came the Scottish bagpipes. Hugh John crossed
the road, and then he was nearer to the soldiers. Swinging
step, waving plumes, all in review order, came on the famous
regiment. They passed by, and the sound of the pipes soon
grew faint in the distance. Then came more companies
of soldiers and more and more. And ever the sword of
Hugh John flashed to the salute, and his small arm grew
weary as it rose and fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>Then happened the most astonishing thing in the world.
It was the greatest event in Hugh John’s life. There came
to his ear a new sound, the clatter of horses’ hoofs. A
bugle rang out, and Hugh John’s eyes watched the noble
grey horses come tramping along as if proud of their riders.
He stood more erect than ever.</p>

<p>On they came, a fine young officer at their head. He sat
erect on a noble horse, leading one of the finest troops of
horsemen in the world. He saw the small dusty boy in
his red coat standing by the roadside, and he marked his
pale face and his erect bearing. Hugh John had seen soldiers
before, but never any so fine as these. He could
hardly lift his sword, but his hand was steady and he went
through the beautiful movements of the military salute with
order and precision.</p>

<p>The young officer smiled and raised his own sword in
response, as if Hugh John had been one of his own troopers.
The boy’s heart stood still. Could this thing be? A real
soldier had saluted him. But there was something more
wonderful yet to come. The officer turned in his saddle.</p>

<p>“Attention, men. Draw swords!” he cried, and his
voice rang like a trumpet.</p>

<p>There came a glitter of steel as the swords flashed into
line. The horses tossed their heads at the stirring sound.
“Eyes right! Carry swords!” came again the sharp command.
And every blade made a circle of glittering light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
as it rose to the salute. Tears welled up in Hugh John’s
eyes as he stood there in the pride of the honor done to him.
He had been treated as a real soldier by the greatest soldier
there. He was no longer a little dusty boy. Now he was
a soldier indeed.</p>

<p>“Eyes front! Slope swords!” rang the words once more.
The regiment passed by, and only the far drum beats came
back as Hugh John stood silent under the elm tree. When
his father rode up on his way home, he asked the boy what
he was doing there.</p>

<p>Hugh John wanted to laugh, but the tears ran down his
cheeks. “I’m not hurt, father,” he said, “I’m not crying.
It was only that the Scots Greys saluted me. But I’m not
crying, I’m not indeed!” Then the stern man gathered
the great soldier up and set him across his saddle. He was
alone, for the other children had gone to their play. And
thus rode our hero home&mdash;Hugh John Smith no more,
General Napoleon he called himself now.</p>

<p>Late that night Hugh John stole down the hushed driveway,
his bare feet pattering through the dust which the dew
was making cool. He stood again by the roadside where
he had seen the troops march by. Then clasping his hands
he made a solemn vow.</p>

<p>“The Scots Greys saluted me. Never, never, so long as
I live, will I be mean again!”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Samuel R. Crockett.</span></p>

<h2><a id="A_CHILDS_DREAM_OF_A_STAR"></a>A CHILD’S DREAM OF A STAR</h2>


<p>There was once a child, and he strolled about a good deal,
and thought of a number of things. He had a sister, who
was a child too, and his constant companion. These two
used to wonder all day long. They wondered at the beauty
of the flowers; they wondered at the height and blueness of
the sky; they wondered at the goodness and the power of
God, who made the lovely world.</p>

<p>They used to say to one another sometimes, “Supposing
all the children upon earth were to die, would the flowers,
and the water, and the sky be sorry?” They believed they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
would be sorry. “For,” said they, “the buds are the children
of the flowers, and the little playful streams that gambol
down the hillsides are the children of the water; and
the smallest bright specks, playing at hide-and-seek in the
sky all night, must surely be the children of the stars; and
they would always be grieved to see their playmates, the
children of men, no more.”</p>

<p>There was one clear-shining star that used to come out
in the sky before the rest, near the church spire, above the
graves. It was larger and more beautiful, they thought,
than all the others, and every night they watched for it,
standing hand-in-hand at a window. Whoever saw it first
cried out, “I see the star!” And often they cried out both
together, knowing so well when it would rise, and where.
So they grew to be such friends with it, that before lying
down on their beds, they always looked out once again, to
bid it good-night; and when they were turning round to
sleep they used to say, “God bless the star!”</p>

<p>But while she was still very young,&mdash;oh, very, very young,&mdash;the
sister drooped, and came to be so weak, that she could
no longer stand at the window at night; and then the child
looked sadly out by himself, and when he saw the star,
turned round and said to the patient, pale face on the bed,
“I see the star!” and then a smile would come upon the
face, and a little, weak voice used to say, “God bless my
brother and the star!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>And so the time came, all too soon! when the child looked
out alone, and when there was no face on the bed; and
when there was a little grave among the graves, not there
before; and when the star made long rays down towards
him, as he saw it through his tears.</p>

<p>Now, these rays were so bright, and they seemed to make
such a shining way from earth to heaven, that when the
child went to his solitary bed, he dreamed about the star;
and dreamed that, lying where he was, he saw a train of
people taken up that sparkling road by angels. And the
star, opening, showed him a great world of light, where
many more such angels waited to receive him.</p>

<p>All these angels, who were waiting, turned their beaming
eyes upon the people who were carried up into the star; and
some came out from the long rows in which they stood,
and fell upon the people’s necks, and kissed them tenderly,
and went away with them down avenues of light, and were
so happy in their company, that, lying in his bed, he wept
for joy.</p>

<p>But there were many angels who did not go with them,
and among them one he knew. The patient face that once
had lain upon the bed was glorified and radiant, but his heart
found out his sister among all the host. His sister’s angel
lingered near the entrance of the star, and said to the leader
among those who had brought the people thither, “Is my
brother come?” And he said, “No.” She was turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
hopefully away, when the child stretched out his arms, and
cried, “O sister, I am here! Take me!” And then she
turned her beaming eyes upon him, and it was night; and
the star was shining into the room, making long rays down
towards him, as he saw it through his tears. From that
hour forth, the child looked out upon the star as on the Home
he was to go to when his time should come; and he thought
that he did not belong to the earth alone, but to the star
too, because of his sister’s angel gone before. There was
a baby born to be a brother to the child; and whilst he was
so little that he never yet had spoken a word, he stretched
his tiny form out on the bed, and died.</p>

<p>Again the child dreamed of the open star, and of the
company of angels, and the train of people, and the rows
of angels, with their beaming eyes all turned upon those
people’s faces. Said his sister’s angel to the leader, “Is
my brother come?” And he said, “Not that one, but another.”
As the child beheld his brother’s angel in her arms,
he cried, “O sister, I am here! Take me!” And she turned
and smiled upon him, and the star was shining.</p>

<p>He grew to be a young man, and was busy at his books,
when an old servant came to him, and said, “Thy mother
is no more. I bring her blessing on her darling son!”
Again at night he saw the star, and all the former company.
Said his sister’s angel to the leader, “Is my brother come?”
And he said, “Thy mother!” A mighty cry of joy went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
forth through all the star, because the mother was reunited
to her two children. And he cried, “O mother, sister,
and brother, I am here! Take me!” And they answered
him, “Not yet,” and the star was shining.</p>

<p>He grew to be a man whose hair was turning gray, and he
was sitting in his chair by the fireside, heavy with grief, and
with his face bedewed with tears, when the star opened
once again. Said his sister’s angel to the leader, “Is my
brother come?” And he said, “Nay, but his maiden daughter.”
And the man who had been the child saw his daughter
newly lost to him, a celestial creature among those three,
and he said, “My daughter’s head is on my sister’s bosom,
and her arm is round my mother’s neck, and at her feet there
is the baby of old time, and I can bear the parting from her&mdash;God
be praised!” And the star was shining.</p>

<p>Thus the child came to be an old man, and his face was
wrinkled, and his steps were slow, and his back was bent.
One night, as he lay upon his bed, his children standing
around, he cried, as he had cried so long ago, “I see the
star!” They whispered to one another, “He is dying.”
And he said, “I am. My age is falling from me like a garment,
and I move towards the star as a child. And, O
my Father, now I thank Thee that it has so often opened,
to receive those dear ones who await me!” And the star
was shining; and it shines upon his grave.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_SENTINELS_POUCH"></a>THE SENTINEL’S POUCH</h2>


<p>Private William Baum, of the Prussian army, as he stood
peering into the darkness, was almost wishing that the
Austrians and Russians, whose camp-fires he could see along
the other side of the valley, would make an attack, and give
him something else to do than shiver in the wet. But they
did not; and Baum, growing colder and wetter every minute,
wished himself back in his snug little apple-orchard at the
foot of the Giant Mountains, where he used to be in bed
every night before the village clock tolled ten, after a good
supper of brown bread and cabbage.</p>

<p>“If the king had to be out in a night of this sort,” he said
aloud, “he’d soon be as tired of war as I am.”</p>

<p>“And how do you know he hasn’t?” broke in a sharp
voice, close beside him.</p>

<p>At once Baum was himself again. The first sign of a
stranger approaching his post recalled him to his duty as a
soldier.</p>

<p>His musket was at his shoulder in a moment, and his
voice rang out clear and stern,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Stand! Who goes there?”</p>

<p>“A friend,” replied the unknown.</p>

<p>“Advance, friend, and give the pass-word.”</p>

<p>“‘The Prussian eagle.’”</p>

<p>“Pass, friend; all’s well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>But instead of passing on, the stranger came close up to
the sentry, who could just make out by a stray gleam of
moonlight, that his visitor was wrapped in a horseman’s
cloak, and had a hat drawn over his eyes in such a way as to
hide his face.</p>

<p>“You seem to have rather damp quarters here, comrade,”
said he. “Why don’t you have a smoke to warm yourself
a bit?”</p>

<p>“Smoke!” replied the sentry. “Why, where do you
come from, brother, not to know that smoking on duty is
forbidden?”</p>

<p>“But suppose the king gave you leave to smoke?” said
the stranger.</p>

<p>“The king!” answered the soldier, gruffly. “What
would my captain say? Long before the king could hear
of it, the drummer’s cane would make acquaintance with
my back.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! the captain’s not here to see you. Out with your
pipe, man. I’ll tell no tales.”</p>

<p>“Look here, you rascal!” cried the soldier, in an angry
tone, “I half suspect you’re some fellow who wants to get
me into trouble. Now, if that’s so, you had better be off
before worse comes of it; for if you say any more, I’ll give
you a cuff you won’t like.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see you try it,” said the other, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The soldier’s only reply was a blow which sent the stran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>ger’s
battered old hat flying into the air, while he himself
staggered back several paces.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said he, recovering himself, and speaking
in quite a different tone. “You’ll hear of this to-morrow,
my man, and get what you deserve, never fear. Goodnight
to you.”</p>

<p>He stooped as he spoke, and picking up something from
the ground, vanished into the darkness.</p>

<p>The sudden change in his unknown visitor’s tone and
manner, and his parting threat, caused some uneasiness to
Baum. He began to fear that he had insulted an officer of
high rank&mdash;a colonel at the very least, perhaps even a
general.</p>

<p>“However,” thought he, “he doesn’t know my name,
that’s one comfort; and he won’t find it very easy to describe
the spot where I was posted, seeing that the night is so dark.”</p>

<p>But the next moment he gave a terrible start, for he had
just missed his tobacco-pouch, which usually hung at his
belt; and he remembered having seen the stranger pick up
something as he went off. It must have been the pouch,
and his name was upon it in full.</p>

<p>There was not much sleep for poor Baum that night,
although he was relieved from guard half an hour later.
He tried to keep up his courage by telling himself over and
over again that the general could hardly punish him for
obeying orders; but even this did not comfort him much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
for in those days there were very few things which a general
could not do to a private soldier.</p>

<p>The next morning, sure enough, a corporal and four men
came to conduct Private William Baum to headquarters;
and when he got there, he found all the generals standing
around a little, lean, bright-eyed man, in a very shabby dress,
whom Baum knew at once to be the king himself&mdash;Frederick
the Great of Prussia.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Frederick, and with a sharp glance
at the unlucky sentry, “what does a Prussian soldier deserve,
who strikes his king?”</p>

<p>“Death,” answered the generals with one voice.</p>

<p>“Good!” said Frederick. “Here is the man.” And he
held out a tobacco-pouch marked with the name of “William
Baum.”</p>

<p>“Mercy, sire, mercy!” cried Baum, falling on his knees.
“I never thought it was Your Majesty with whom I was
speaking.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose you did,” said the king, clapping
him on the shoulder; “and I hope all my soldiers will
obey orders as well as you do. I said you should get what
you deserve, and so you shall; for I’ll make you a sergeant
this very day.”</p>

<p>And the king kept his word.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Selected.</span></p>

<h2><a name="TOM_THE_WATER-BABY" id="TOM_THE_WATER-BABY"></a>TOM, THE WATER-BABY</h2>


<p>One day Tom had a new adventure. He was sitting
on a water-lily leaf, he and his friend the dragon-fly, watching
the gnats dance. The dragon-fly had eaten as many
as he wanted, and was sitting quite still and sleepy, for it
was very hot and bright.</p>

<p>The gnats danced a foot over his head quite happily,
and a large black fly settled within an inch of his nose and
began washing his own face and combing his hair with
his paws. But the dragon-fly never stirred, and kept on
chatting to Tom about the times when he lived under the
water.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom heard the strangest noise up the stream.
He looked up the water, and there he saw a sight as strange
as the noise; a great ball rolling over and over down the
stream, seeming one moment of soft brown fur, and the next
of shining glass. Yet it was not a ball; for sometimes it
broke up and streamed away into pieces, and then it joined
again; and all the while the noise came out of it louder and
louder.</p>

<p>Tom asked the dragon-fly what it could be; but of course,
with his short sight, he could not even see it, though it was
not ten yards away. So Tom set off to see for himself;
and when he came near, the ball turned out to be four or five
beautiful otters, many times larger than Tom, who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
swimming about, and rolling and diving, and twisting and
scratching in the most charming fashion that ever was seen.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/p235.jpg" alt="Tom hiding" />
</div>

<p>But when the biggest of them saw Tom, she darted out
from the rest, and cried in the water-language sharply
enough, “Quick, children, here is something to eat, indeed!”
and came at poor Tom, showing such a wicked pair of eyes
and such a set of sharp
teeth in a grinning
mouth, that Tom, who
had thought her very
handsome, said to himself,
“Handsome is that
handsome does,” and
slipped in between the
water-lily roots as fast
as he could, and then turned around and laughed at her.</p>

<p>“Come out,” said the wicked old otter, “or it will be the
worse for you.”</p>

<p>But Tom looked at her from between two thick roots,
and shook them with all his might.</p>

<p>“Come away, children,” said the otter. “It is not worth
eating, after all. It is only an eft, which nothing eats.”</p>

<p>“I am not an eft!” said Tom. “Efts have tails.”</p>

<p>“You are an eft,” said the otter. “I see your two hands
quite plainly, and I know that you have a tail.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I have not,” said Tom. “Look here!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>”
and he turned his pretty little self quite round; and sure
enough, he had no more tail than you have.</p>

<p>The otter might have got out of it by saying that Tom
was a frog; but, like a great many other people, when she
had once said a thing she stood to it, right or wrong.</p>

<p>“I say you are an eft,” said the otter, “and therefore
you are, and not fit food for gentlefolk like me and my
children; you may stay there till the salmon eat you.”
She knew the salmon would not, but she wished to frighten
poor Tom.</p>

<p>“What are salmon?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Fish, you eft; great fish, nice to eat. They are the
lords of the fish, and we are lords of the salmon;” and she
laughed again. “They are coming soon, children, coming
soon; I can smell the rain coming up off the sea. Then
hurrah for fresh salmon and plenty of eating all day long.”</p>

<p>The otter grew so proud that she turned head over heels
twice, and then stood upright half out of the water, grinning
like a Cheshire cat.</p>

<p>“And where do they come from?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Out of the sea, eft,&mdash;the great wide sea, where they
might stay and be safe if they liked.”</p>

<p>Then the otter sailed away down the brook, and Tom
saw her no more for that time. And lucky it was for
her that she did so; for no sooner was she gone than
down the bank came seven little rough terrier dogs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
snuffing and yapping, grubbing and splashing, in full
cry after the otter.</p>

<p>Tom hid among the water-lilies till they were gone;
for he could not guess that they were the water-fairies
come to help him. But he could not help thinking of what
the otter had said about the great river and the broad sea.
As he thought, he longed to go and see them. He could not
tell why; but the more he thought, the more he grew discontented
with the narrow little stream in which he lived,
and with all his companions. He wished to get out into
the wide, wide world, and enjoy all the wonderful sights
of which he was sure it was full.</p>

<p>Once he set off to go down the stream, but the stream
was very low, and when he came to the shallows he could
not keep under water, for there was no water left to keep
under. So the sun burned his back and made him sick;
and he went back again and lay quiet in the pool for a whole
week more.</p>

<p>Then on the evening of a very hot day he saw a wonderful
sight. He had been very stupid all day, and so had the
trout; for they would not move an inch to take a fly, though
there were thousands on the water; but lay dozing on the
bottom under the shade of the stones. Tom lay dozing too,
and was glad to cuddle their smooth, cool sides, for the water
was warm and unpleasant.</p>

<p>Towards evening it grew suddenly dark, and Tom looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
up and saw a blanket of black clouds lying across the valley
above his head. He felt not quite frightened, but sat very
still; for everything was still. There was not a whisper of
wind nor a chirp of a bird to be heard. Next a few drops of
rain fell into the water. One hit Tom on the nose, and made
him pop his head down quickly enough. Then the thunder
roared, and the lightning flashed from cloud to cloud and
cliff to cliff, till the rocks in the stream seemed to shake.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p238.jpg" alt="The storm" />
</div>


<p>Tom looked up at it through the water, and thought
it the finest thing he ever saw in his life. Out of the water
he dare not put his head; for the rain came down by buckets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>ful,
and the hail fell like shot on the stream, and churned
it into foam. Soon the stream rose and rushed down, higher
and higher, full of beetles and sticks and straws. Tom could
hardly stand against the stream, and hid behind a rock. But
the trout did not hide; for out they rushed from among the
stones, and began gobbling the beetles and leeches in the
most greedy and quarrelsome way; swimming about with
great worms in their mouths, tugging and kicking to get them
away from each other.</p>

<p>By the flashes of lightning Tom saw a new sight&mdash;all
the bottom of the stream alive with great eels, turning and
twisting along, all down stream and away. They had been
hiding for weeks past in the cracks of the rocks and in burrows
in the mud. Tom had hardly ever seen them except
now and then at night; but now they were all out, and went
hurrying past him so fiercely and wildly that he was quite
frightened.</p>

<p>As they hurried past he could hear them say to each
other, “We must hurry! We must hurry! What a jolly
thunder-storm! Down to the sea! Down to the sea!”</p>

<p>Then the otter came by with all her brood, twining and
sweeping along as fast as the eels themselves.</p>

<p>She spied Tom as she came by and said, “Now is your
time, eft, if you wish to see the world. Come along, children,
never mind those eels; we shall breakfast on salmon
to-morrow. Down to the sea! Down to the sea!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>Then came a flash brighter than all the rest, and by the
light of it&mdash;in the thousandth part of a second they were
gone again&mdash;but he had seen them, he was certain of it&mdash;three
beautiful little white girls, with their arms twined
round each other’s necks, floating down the torrent, as they
sang, “Down to the sea! Down to the sea!”</p>

<p>“Oh, stay! Wait for me!” cried Tom; but they were
gone. Yet he could hear their voices clear and sweet
through the roar of thunder and water and wind, singing
as they died away, “Down to the sea!”</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/p240.jpg" alt="Tom with fish" />
</div>

<p>“Down to the sea?” said Tom. “Everything is going
to the sea, and I shall go, too. Good-by, trout.”</p>

<p>Now down the rushing stream he went, guided by the
bright flashes of the storm; past tall birch-fringed rocks,
which shone out one moment as clear as day, and the next
were dark as night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>Past dark coves under the banks, from which great trout
rushed out on Tom, thinking him to be good to eat, but
turned back quickly, for the fairies sent them home again
with a scolding for daring to meddle with a water-baby.
Along deep reaches, where the white water-lilies tossed
and flapped beneath the wind and hail; past sleeping
villages; under dark bridges, and away and away to the sea.
Tom could not stop, and did not care to stop; he would see
the great world below, and the salmon, and the breakers,
and the wide, wide sea.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles Kingsley.</span></p>

<h2><a id="LAURA_SECORD"></a>LAURA SECORD</h2>


<p>In the year 1812 the United States of America declared
war against Great Britain. They were eager to conquer
Canada and seemed confident of success. The Canadians
were filled with dismay at the news, for their country was
then in a desperate position. In the whole of Canada there
were less than forty-five hundred regular troops. Great
Britain was at war with Napoleon and could not lend
much aid; but the brave men who responded to the call
to arms were determined to repel the invaders and to save
their country.</p>

<p>One of the most terrible battles of the war was fought
in October, at Queenston Heights on the Niagara River.
It resulted in a victory for the Canadians, but the victory
was dearly bought. Brave General Brock was killed, and
the battle-field was strewn with the bodies of volunteers
who had died or been wounded in defence of their homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>Among those who had been wounded, and lay helpless
on the hillside, was Captain James Secord of Queenston.
Laura Secord, his wife, had watched the battle from a distance,
and hearing of his danger rushed up the hill to his
aid. While she knelt at his side, three American soldiers
attempted to kill him, but the slender, pale-faced woman
stood in front of her wounded husband and called for help.
The captain of the cowardly soldiers ordered them away,
and Laura Secord, believing her husband to be dead, lifted
him in her arms and carried him to their home. It was
soon found that he still lived, and his wife’s tender nursing
saved his life. When the summer came again, he was still
an invalid and unable to walk.</p>

<p>The Canadians had retired from Queenston and the
town was occupied by an American force. The Secords
had been compelled to remain in the neighborhood on
account of the captain’s health, and were frequently forced
to entertain the enemy in their home.</p>

<p>One June day a number of officers entered the house and
commanded Mrs. Secord to give them food. She pretended
to be a very humble and dull person, and began at once to
prepare the meal. In the meantime the officers discussed
their general’s plans, and did not pay much attention to
the woman who had appeared so simple. Laura Secord,
however, listened to all they said, and discovered that
they intended to surprise the little handful of soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
who were defending Beaver Dam, and capture Lieutenant
Fitzgibbon, the officer in charge.</p>

<p>When James Secord heard this news, he was in despair.
The defenders of Beaver Dam should be warned of the
attack, but how could he, a crippled soldier, carry the
message? He was trying to think of a way out of the
difficulty when his wife startled him by saying, “I shall
take the message, to-morrow at daybreak. You are unable
to go, and there is no one else.”</p>

<p>This meant that she would have to pass the American
pickets, and travel in the heat, through twenty miles of
bush. The woods were infested with fierce Indians belonging
to both armies, and attacks from them were always
to be expected. Her husband was unwilling to let her go,
but seeing no other way, he finally consented.</p>

<p>Laura Secord arose at daybreak on the morning of the
23d of June, and began to prepare for her journey.
Dressed in a short flannel skirt and cotton jacket, without
shoes or stockings, her milking-stool in one hand, her pail
in the other, she drove one of her cows close to the American
lines and sat down to milk it. Immediately the cow
kicked over the milking-pail and ran towards the bush.
This happened two or three times and the soldiers laughed
heartily, and chaffed at the sullen milkmaid’s clumsiness.
She mumbled something about the cow being “contrary”
and ran past the sentry into the bush to catch it. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
scant clothing and her evident anger at the cow deceived
the man, who let her pass without asking any questions.
He did not know that the cow’s antics had been caused by
the pinches Mrs. Secord had given it, and that the angry
milkmaid was hurrying on her way to Beaver Dam.</p>

<p>A mile away she hid the pail and stool under the bushes,
first milking the cow to prevent her returning too soon to
the clearing. Hour after hour she tramped on, going
over unbeaten paths to avoid the American scouts. The
underbrush in the first of the forest was tangled and dense.
Soon her feet were torn and bleeding, and every step she
took gave her pain. The slopes of the hills were thick
with brush and hard to climb, and swamps and streams
had to be crossed in the most dangerous ways. When night
came, it was hard to tell which of the many blazed trails
she should take, and faint with hunger and pain she fell to
the ground many times.</p>

<p>About midnight she came to a clearing and began to
hope her journey was nearly ended, when the air was filled
with the war-whoop of the Red Indians. She was soon
surrounded by a dozen savages who were covered with warpaint
and decked with feathers. Thinking her to be a spy,
one of them stepped close to her and demanded, “Woman!
what does woman want?” She was terrified, but knew
that everything depended upon her self-possession. She
asked for the “Big Chief” and explained by signs that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
“Long knives” (the Americans) were coming, and that
she must reach the British. She soon discovered that the
Indians were scouts of the British and that she need have
no fear. With a hearty “Ugh” of understanding, one of
them beckoned her to follow, and led the way through the
meadows to the British lines.</p>

<p>She gave her message to Lieutenant Fitzgibbon, who
praised her bravery and made her comfortable for the rest
of the night. Her warning prepared the little garrison for
the attack which took place next day, and so well were
the plans made that the fifty men under Fitzgibbon compelled
the American force of five hundred soldiers to
surrender, almost without a struggle.</p>

<p>Laura Secord lived to be ninety-three years old, and
when she died in 1868, she was buried beside her husband
on the ground which had been the old battle-field of Lundy’s
Lane. A handsome monument was erected over her grave
by Canadians, who wished to do honor to the great courage
of the woman who saved her countrymen from danger and
defeat.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Helen Palk.</span></p>

<h2><a id="HOW_THE_MOUNTAIN_WAS_CLAD"></a>HOW THE MOUNTAIN WAS CLAD</h2>


<p>There was a deep gorge between two mountains.
Through this gorge a large full stream flowed heavily
over a rough and stony bottom. Both sides were high
and steep, and one side was bare; but close to its foot,
and so near the stream that the latter sprinkled it with
moisture every spring and autumn, stood a group of fresh-looking
trees gazing upwards and onwards, yet unable to
advance this way or that.</p>

<p>“What if we should clothe the mountain,” said the juniper
one day to the foreign oak, to which it stood nearer
than all others. The oak looked down to find out who
it was that spoke, and then it looked up again without
deigning a reply. The river rushed along so violently that
it worked itself into a white foam; the north wind forced
its way through the gorge, and shrieked in the clefts of the
rocks; the naked mountain, with its great weight, hung
heavily over and felt cold. “What if we should clothe the
mountain?” said the juniper to the fir on the other side.
“If anybody is to do it, I suppose it must be we,” said the
fir, taking hold of its beard and glancing towards the birch.
“What do you think?” But the birch peered cautiously
up the mountain, which hung over it so threateningly that
it seemed as if it could scarcely breathe. “Let us clothe it
in God’s name!” said the birch. And so, though there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
were but these three, they undertook to clothe the mountain.
The juniper went first.</p>

<p>When they had gone a little way they met the heather.
The juniper seemed as though about to pass it. “Nay,
take the heather along,” said the fir. And the heather
joined them. Soon it began to glide on before the juniper.
“Catch hold of me,” said the heather. The juniper did so,
and where there was only a wee crevice the heather thrust
in a finger, and where it first had placed a finger, the juniper
took hold with its whole hand. They crawled and crept
along, the fir laboring on behind, the birch also. “This is
well worth doing,” said the birch.</p>

<p>But the mountain began to ponder on what manner
of objects these might be that were clambering up over it.
And after it had been considering the matter a few hundred
years, it sent a little brook down to inquire. It was yet in
the time of the spring freshets, and the brook stole on until
it reached the heather. “Dear, dear heather, cannot you
let me pass? I am so small.” The heather was very busy;
only raised itself a little and pressed onwards. In, under,
and onwards went the brook. “Dear, dear juniper, cannot
you let me pass? I am so small.” The juniper looked
sharply at it; but if the heather had let it pass, why, in all
reason, it must do so too. Under it and onwards went the
brook; and now came to the spot where the fir stood puffing
on the hillside. “Dear, dear fir, cannot you let me pass?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
I am really so small,” said the brook, and it kissed the fir’s
feet and made itself so very sweet. The fir became bashful
at this, and let it pass, but the birch raised itself before the
brook asked it. “Hi, hi, hi!” said the birch, and grew.
“Ha, ha, ha!” said the brook, and grew. “Ho, ho, ho!”
said the brook, and flung the heather and the juniper and the
fir and the birch flat on their faces and backs, up and down
these great hills. The mountain sat up for many hundred
years musing on whether it had not smiled a little that day.</p>

<p>It was plain enough the mountain did not want to be
clad. The heather fretted over this until it grew green
again, and then started forward. “Fresh courage!” said
the heather.</p>

<p>The juniper had half raised itself to look at the heather,
and continued to keep this position, until at length it
stood upright. It scratched its head, and set forth again,
taking such a vigorous foothold that it seemed as though
the mountain must feel it. “If you will not have me, then
I shall have you.” The fir crooked its toes a little to find out
whether they were whole, then lifted one foot, found it whole,
then the other, which proved also to be whole, then both of
them. It first examined the ground it had been over;
next, where it had been lying; and finally, where it should
go. After this, it began to wend its way slowly along,
and acted as though it had never fallen. The birch had
become most wretchedly soiled, but now rose up and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
itself tidy. Then they sped onwards, faster and faster upwards,
and on either side in sunshine and in rain. “What
in the world can this be?” said the mountain, all glittering
with dew, as the summer sun shone down on it. The birds
sang, the wood-mouse piped, the hare hopped along, and
the ermine hid itself and screamed.</p>

<p>Then the day came when the heather could peep with
one eye over the edge of the mountain. “Oh dear, oh dear,
oh dear!” said the heather, and away it went. “Dear me!
what is it the heather sees?” said the juniper, and moved
on until it could peer up. “Oh dear, oh dear!” it shrieked,
and was gone.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the juniper to-day?” said
the fir, and took long strides onwards in the heat of the sun.
Soon it could raise itself on its toes and peep up. “Oh
dear!” Branches and needles stood on end in wonderment.
It worked its way forward, came up, and was gone.
“What is it all the others see, and not I?” said the birch;
and lifting well its skirts it tripped after. It stretched its
whole head up at once. “Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;is not here a great
forest of fir and heather, of juniper and birch standing on the
table-land waiting for us?” said the birch; and its leaves
quivered in the sunshine so that the dew trembled. “Ay,
this is what it is to reach the goal!” said the juniper.</p>

<h2><a id="BEAUTIFUL_JOE"></a>BEAUTIFUL JOE</h2>


<p>I was born in a stable on the outskirts of a small town.
The first thing I remember was lying close to my mother
and being very snug and warm. The next thing I remember
was being always hungry.
I am very unwilling to say much
about my early life. I have lived
so long in a family where there
is never a harsh word spoken,
and where no one thinks of ill-treating
anybody or anything,
that it seems almost wrong even
to think or speak of such a matter
as hurting a poor dumb beast.</p>

<div class="figright" >
<img src="images/p259.jpg" alt="Joe" />
</div>

<p>The man that owned my mother was a milkman. He
kept one horse and three cows, and he had a shaky old cart
that he used to put his milk-cans in. I don’t think there
can be a worse man in the world than that milkman.
He used to beat and starve my mother. I have seen
him use his heavy whip to punish her. When I got older
I asked her why she did not run away. She said she did
not wish to; but I soon found out that the reason that she
did not run away was because she loved her master. Cruel
and savage as he was, she yet loved him, and I believe she
would have laid down her life for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p class="pcap2">The Wounded Hound</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

<p>One reason for our master’s cruelty was his idleness.
After he went his rounds in the morning with his milk-cans,
he had nothing to do till late in the afternoon but take care
of his stable and yard. If he had kept them clean, it
would have taken up all his time; but he never did anything
to make his home neat and pleasant.</p>

<p>My mother and I slept on a heap of straw in the corner
of the stable, and when she heard his step in the morning
she always roused me, so that we could run out as soon as
he opened the stable door. He always aimed a kick at us
as we passed, but my mother taught me how to dodge him.</p>

<p>After our master put the horse in the cart, and took in
the cans, he set out on his rounds. My mother always
went with him. I used to ask her why she followed such
a man, and she would say that sometimes she got a bone
from the different houses they stopped at. But that was
not the whole reason. She liked the master so much, that
in spite of his cruelty she wanted to be with him.</p>

<p>I had not her sweet and patient disposition, and I would
not go with her. I watched her out of sight, and then ran
up to the house to see if the master’s wife had any scraps
for me. I nearly always got something, for she pitied me,
and often gave me a kind word or look with the bits of food
that she threw to me.</p>

<p>I had a number of brothers and sisters&mdash;six in all. One
rainy day when we were eight weeks old the master, followed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
by two or three of his ragged, dirty children, came into the
stable, and looked at us. Then he began to swear because
we were so ugly, and said if we had been good looking, he
might have sold some of us. Mother watched him anxiously,
fearing some danger to her puppies, and looked up at him
pleadingly. It only made him swear the more. He took
one puppy after another, and right there, before his children
and my poor distracted mother, put an end to their
lives. It was very terrible. I lay weak and trembling,
expecting every instant that my turn would come next. I
don’t know why he spared me. I was the only one left.</p>

<p>My mother never seemed the same after this. She was
weak and miserable. And though she was only four years
old, she seemed like an old dog. She could not run after
the master, and she lay on our heap of straw, only turning
over with her nose the scraps of food I brought her to eat.
One day she licked me gently, wagged her tail, and died.</p>

<p>As I sat by her, feeling lonely and miserable, my master
came into the stable. I could not bear to look at him. He
had killed my mother. There she lay, a little gaunt,
scarred creature, starved and worried to death by him.
She would never again look kindly at me, or curl up to me
at night to keep me warm. Oh, how I hated her murderer!
Still I kept quiet till he walked up to me and kicked at me.
My heart was nearly broken, and I could stand no more. I
flew at him and gave him a savage bite on the ankle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p>“Oho!” he said. “So you are going to be a fighter, are
you? I’ll fix you for that.” He seized me by the back of
the neck and carried me out to the yard where a log lay
on the ground. “Tom,” he called to one of his children,
“bring me the hatchet!”</p>

<p>He laid my head on the log and pressed one hand on my
struggling body. There was a quick, dreadful pain, and he
had cut off my ear close to my head. Then he cut off the
other ear, and turning me swiftly round, cut off my tail.
Then he let me go, and stood looking at me as I rolled on
the ground and yelped in agony. He was in such a passion
that he did not think that people passing on the street
might hear me.</p>

<p>There was a young man going by. He heard my screams,
and hurrying up the path stood among us before the master
caught sight of him.</p>

<p>In the midst of my pain, I heard the young man say,
fiercely, “What have you been doing to that dog?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been cutting his ears, for fighting, my young gentleman,”
said my master; “there is no law to prevent that,
is there?”</p>

<p>“And there is no law to prevent me from taking a dog
away from such a cruel owner, either,” cried the young man;
and giving the master an angry look, he snatched me up in
his arms, and walked down the path and out of the gate.</p>

<p>I was moaning with pain, but still I looked up occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>ally
to see which way we were going. We took the road
to the town and stopped in front of a pleasant-looking
home. Carrying me gently in his arms, the young man went
up a walk leading to the back of the house. There was a
small stable there. He went into it and put me down on
the floor. Some boys were playing about the stable, and
I heard them say, in horrified tones, “Oh, Cousin Harry,
what is the matter with that dog?”</p>

<p>“Hush,” he said. “Don’t say anything. You, Jack,
go down to the kitchen and ask Mary for a basin of warm
water and a sponge, and don’t let your mother or Laura
hear you.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the young man had bathed my ears
and tail, and had rubbed something on them that was cool
and pleasant, and had bandaged them firmly with strips of
cotton. I felt much better and was able to look about me.</p>

<p>Presently one of the boys cried out, “Here is Laura.”
A young girl, holding up one hand to shade her eyes from
the sun, was coming up the walk that led from the house
to the stable. I thought then that I never had seen such
a beautiful girl, and I think so still. She was tall and slender,
and had lovely brown eyes and brown hair, and a sweet smile,
and just to look at her was enough to make one love her.</p>

<p>“Why, what a funny dog!” she said, and stopped short
and looked at me. Up to this, I had not thought what a
queer-looking sight I must be. Now I twisted round my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
head, saw the white bandage on my tail, and knowing I
was not a fit spectacle for a pretty young lady like that,
I slunk into a corner.</p>

<p>“Poor doggie, have I hurt your feelings?” she said.
“What is the matter with your head, good dog?”</p>

<p>“Dear Laura,” said the young man, coming up, “he got
hurt, and I have been bandaging him.”</p>

<p>“Who hurt him?”</p>

<p>“I would rather not tell you.”</p>

<p>“But I wish to know.” Her voice was as gentle as ever,
but she spoke so decidedly that the young man was obliged
to tell her everything. All the time he was speaking she
kept touching me gently with her fingers. When he had
finished his account of rescuing me from the master, she
said quietly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You will have the man punished?”</p>

<p>“What is the use? That won’t stop him from being
cruel.”</p>

<p>“It will put a check on his cruelty.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would do any good,” said the young
man.</p>

<p>“Cousin Harry!” and the young girl stood up very
straight and tall, her brown eyes flashing, and one hand
pointing at me. “That animal has been wronged; it looks
to you to right it. The coward who has maimed it for life
should be punished. A child has a voice to tell its wrong,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
&mdash;a poor, dumb creature must suffer in silence; in bitter,
bitter silence. And you are doing the man himself an injustice.
If he is bad enough to illtreat his dog, he will
illtreat his wife and children. If he is checked and punished
now for his cruelty, he may reform. And even if his
wicked heart is not changed, he will be obliged to treat
them with outward kindness through fear of punishment.
I want you to report that man immediately. I shall go
with you if you like.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, and together they went off to the
house.</p>

<p>The boys came and bent over me, as I lay on the floor in
the corner. I wasn’t much used to boys, and I didn’t know
how they would treat me. It seemed very strange to have
them pat me, and call me “good dog.” No one had ever
said that to me before to-day.</p>

<p>One of them said, “What did Cousin Harry say the dog’s
name was?”</p>

<p>“Joe,” answered another boy.</p>

<p>“We might call him ‘Ugly Joe,’ then,” said a lad with a
round fat face and laughing eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Laura would like that,” said Jack, coming
up behind him. “You see,” he went on, “if you call him
‘Ugly Joe,’ she will say that you are wounding the dog’s
feelings. ‘Beautiful Joe’ would be more to her liking.”</p>

<p>A shout went up from the boys. I don’t wonder they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
laughed. Plain-looking I naturally was; but I must have
been hideous in those bandages.</p>

<p>“‘Beautiful,’ then, let it be,” they cried. “Let us go
and tell mother, and ask her to give us something for our
beauty to eat,” and they all trooped out of the stable.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_BEAVERS"></a>THE BEAVERS</h2>


<p>There were plenty of little low houses in the pond, and
in each one lived a family of beavers. It was the delight of
the little beavers to explore every corner of the pond, from
the brook at the upper end to the dam at the lower end.</p>

<p>Very likely the little fellows believed that the dam had
always been there. But, in fact, the old beavers had built it
themselves. When they first came to that spot in the woods,
they found only a brook flowing over a hard, gravelly bottom.
They first cut down a bush and floated it along till
it stuck fast between a rock and a clump of trees. Next
they cut other bushes, and carried down poles and branches,
till they had a tangle of brush stretching from one bank to
the other. Upon this they piled sticks and stones and
mud, and then more sticks and stones and mud, and then
still more sticks and stones and mud.</p>

<p>At last the dam was so high and solid that the water could
not flow through. So it spread out in a pond above the
dam till it was deep enough to trickle over the top and
tinkle away in a little brook under the trees.</p>

<p>Tiny islands were left here and there in the pond. The
old beavers built their houses on the islands or on the bank.
First each mother and father dug two tunnels from the bottom
of the pond up through the earth to the floor of their
house. One tunnel was to be used when going in and out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a><br /><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
during the summer. The other tunnel led to their winter
pantry under the water. This pantry was to be a pile of
fresh sticks cut in the woods every autumn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p271.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Beavers at Work</span></div>
</div>

<p>Around the two holes in the floor the beavers laid logs
and stones in a circle. Upon this foundation they piled
sticks and sod to form walls and a roof. Then they plastered
the house all over with mud. At the top of the roof
they left a small hole, covered only with a tangle of sticks.
This was for fresh air. Last of all they swam inside and
made the walls even by gnawing off the sharp ends of the
wood. Then the house was ready to be furnished with beds
of leaves and grasses.</p>

<p>Perhaps during the happy summer the baby beavers
believed that play was the most delightful thing in the world.
But soon the father beavers came strolling back to the
village to cut down trees for the winter. Then the little
fellows found that work was even better fun than play.</p>

<p>One night the little beavers followed their parents into
the woods and watched them cut down a tree. The father
stood up on his hind legs, propping himself with his tail,
and began to cut a notch around the trunk. The mother
helped on the other side. They gnawed upwards and downwards,
digging out huge chips with their chisel teeth. The
circle grew deeper and deeper, till the father’s head was
almost hidden whenever he thrust it in to take a fresh bite.
When finally the wood cracked and the tree-top began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
sway, all the family scampered away to the pond. They
dived for the tunnel and hid in the house for a while. There
was danger that some hungry wildcat had heard the crash
of the branches and had hurried there to catch them for
its supper.</p>

<p>As soon as it seemed safe to do so, the beavers paddled
out again and trotted away to the fallen tree. The parents
trimmed off the branches and cut the trunk into pieces
short enough to carry. The father seized a thick pole in his
teeth and swung it over his shoulders. As he dragged it
towards the pond he kept his head twisted to one side,
so that the end of the pole trailed on the ground.</p>

<p>It happened that he reached the pond just in time to help
mend the dam with his thick pole. A pointed log had
jammed a hole in the dam. The water was beginning to
pour through the hole with a rush. If the pond should run
dry, the doors of the tunnels would be left in plain sight.
Then probably a wolf, or some other enemy, would hide
there to catch the beavers on their way from the woods to
their houses.</p>

<p>The old father pushed his pole into the water; then he
jumped in, and taking hold of it with his teeth, he swam
out above the hole. When he let go, the water carried the
pole squarely across the break in the dam. The other
beavers cut bushes and floated them down to weave across
the hole. After that they scooped up mud and stones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
to plaster the dam till not a drop trickled through the
mended places.</p>

<p>The next work to be done that autumn was to gather food
for the winter. Some of the trees with the juiciest bark
grew too far away to be easily dragged to the pond. All
the grown-up beavers set to work to dig a canal. They
dug and scooped and gnawed off roots, and dragged out
stones, till they had made a long canal more than a foot
deep. The water flowed into this from the pond. Then it
was easy enough to float wood from the juicy trees down to
the beaver village.</p>

<p>Even the babies could help in towing the wood down the
canal and across the pond to the different houses. Some of
the wood became so heavy with soaked-up water that it
sank to the bottom beside the doors, and could be packed
in a solid pile as easily as on land. Most of the wood, however,
kept light enough to float. Instead of heaping new
sticks on top, the beavers pushed them under the top
branches. Then more was pressed under that, and more
under that, till the pile reached to the bottom. In the
winter, of course, the top sticks could not be eaten,
because they would be frozen fast in the ice.</p>

<p>All winter long the beavers lived quietly in their little
homes under the snow. Most of the time they slept, each
on his own soft bed in the dark. Whenever they were
hungry, they paddled down the tunnel which led to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
woodpile. Gnawing off some sticks they swam back with
the bundles under their chins. They used the middle of
the room for a dining-table. There they nibbled the bark.
Then they carried the peeled sticks back into the pond.
They did not like to have rubbish left on the floor.</p>

<p>So the winter months slipped away. At last spring melted
the ice on the pond. Here and there in the black water
little brown heads came popping up. They went ploughing
towards shore, leaving the rippled water stretching behind.
Up the banks scrambled the beavers,&mdash;mother beavers
and father beavers, big brother beavers and big sister
beavers, and all the little beavers who had been babies the
year before. Away roamed the fathers up the brook, to
have a good time travelling all summer long. The grown-up
brothers and sisters began to build dams and houses of
their own, while the little fellows wandered into the woods
to find their dinners of tender buds and twigs.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_LITTLE_POSTBOY"></a>THE LITTLE POSTBOY</h2>


<p>In my travels about the world I have made the acquaintance
of a great many children, and I might tell you many
things about their dress, their speech, and their habits of life
in the different countries I have visited. I presume, however,
that you would rather hear me relate some of my
experiences in which children have taken part, so this
shall be the story of my adventure with a little postboy, in
the northern part of Sweden.</p>

<p>Very few foreigners travel in Sweden in the winter, on
account of the intense cold. I made my journey in this
season, however, because I was on my way to Lapland,
where it is easier to travel when the swamps and rivers are
frozen, and the reindeer sleds can fly along over the smooth
snow. It was very cold, indeed, the greater part of the time;
the days were short and dark, and if I had not found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
people so kind, so cheerful, and so honest, I should more
than once have felt inclined to turn back.</p>

<p>But I do not think there are better people in the world
than those who live in Norrland, which is a province in the
northern part of Sweden. They are a tall, strong race, with
yellow hair and bright blue eyes. They live plainly, but
very comfortably, in snug wooden houses, with double
windows and doors to keep out the cold; and since they
cannot do much outdoor work, they spin and weave and
mend their farming implements in the large family room,
thus enjoying the winter in spite of its severity.</p>

<p>Here there are neither railroads nor stages, but the government
has established post stations at distances varying from
ten to twenty miles. At each station a number of horses,
and sometimes vehicles, are kept, but generally the traveller
has his own sled, and simply hires the horses from one
station to another. These horses are furnished either by
the keeper of the station or by some of the neighboring farmers;
and when they are wanted, a man or boy goes with
the traveller to bring them back.</p>

<p>I had my own little sled, filled with hay and covered with
reindeer skins to keep me warm. So long as the weather
was not too cold, it was very pleasant to speed along through
the dark forests, over the frozen rivers, or past farm after
farm in the sheltered valleys, up hill and down until long
after the stars came out, then to get a warm supper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
in some dark red post cottage, while the cheerful people
sang or told stories around the fire.</p>

<p>The cold increased a little every day, to be sure; but I
became gradually accustomed to it, and soon began to fancy
that the Arctic climate was not so difficult to endure as I
had supposed. At first the thermometer fell to zero; then
it went down ten degrees below; then twenty, and finally
thirty. Being dressed in thick furs from head to foot, I did
not suffer greatly; but I was very glad when the people
assured me that such extreme cold never lasted more than
two or three days. Boys of twelve or fourteen very often
went with me to bring their fathers’ horses, and so long as
those lively, red-cheeked fellows could face the weather, it
would not do for me to be afraid.</p>

<p>One night there was a wonderful aurora in the sky. The
streamers of red and blue light darted hither and thither,
chasing each other up to the zenith and down again to the
northern horizon, with a rapidity and a brilliance which I
had never seen before.</p>

<p>“There will be a storm soon,” said my postboy; “one
always comes after these lights.”</p>

<p>Next morning the sky was overcast, and the short day was
as dark as our twilight. But it was not quite so cold, and
I travelled onwards as fast as possible. There was a long
tract of wild and thinly settled country before me, and I
wished to get through it before stopping for the night. Un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>fortunately
it happened that two lumber merchants were
travelling the same way and had taken the post horses;
so I was obliged to wait at the stations until horses were
brought from the neighboring farms. This delayed me so
much that at seven o’clock in the evening I had still one
more station of three Swedish miles before reaching the village
where I intended to spend the night. Now, a Swedish
mile is nearly equal to seven English miles, so that this
station was at least twenty miles long.</p>

<p>I decided to take supper while the horse was eating his
feed. The keeper’s wife&mdash;a friendly, rosy-faced woman&mdash;prepared
me some excellent coffee, potatoes, and stewed
reindeer meat, upon which I made a satisfactory meal.
The house was on the border of a large, dark forest, and the
roar of the icy northern wind in the trees seemed to increase
while I waited in the warm room.</p>

<p>I did not feel inclined to go forth into the wintry storm,
but, having set my mind on reaching the village that night,
I was loath to turn back.</p>

<p>“It is a bad night,” said the woman, “and my husband
who has gone on with the two lumbermen will certainly
stay at Umea until morning. His name is Neils Petersen,
and I think you will find him at the posthouse when you
get there. Lars will take you, and they can come back
together.”</p>

<p>“Who is Lars?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>“My son,” said she. “He is getting the horse ready.
There is nobody else about the house to-night.”</p>

<p>Just then the door opened, and in came Lars. He was
about twelve years old; but his face was so rosy, his eyes
so clear and round and blue, and his golden hair was blown
back from his face in such silky curls, that he appeared to
be even younger. I was surprised that his mother should
be willing to send him twenty miles through the dark woods
on such a night.</p>

<p>“Come here, Lars,” I said. Then I took him by the hand
and asked him, “Are you not afraid to go so far to-night?”</p>

<p>He looked at me with wondering eyes, and smiled, and
his mother made haste to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You need not fear, sir. Lars is young, but he’ll take
you safe enough. If the storm doesn’t get worse, you will
be at Umea by eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>The boy had put on his overcoat of sheepskin, tied the
lappets of his fur cap under his chin and a thick woollen
scarf around his nose and mouth, so that only the round
blue eyes were visible. Drawing on his mittens of hare’s
fur, he took a short leather whip, and was ready.</p>

<p>I wrapped myself in my furs, and we went out together.
The driving snow cut me in the face like needles, but Lars
did not mind it in the least. He jumped into the sled, which
he had filled with fresh, soft hay, tucked in the reindeer skins
at the sides, and we cuddled together on the narrow seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>The night was dark, the snow blew incessantly, and the
tall fir trees roared all around us. Lars, however, knew
the way, and somehow or other we kept the beaten track.
He talked to the horse so cheerfully that my own spirits
began to rise.</p>

<p>“Ho there, Axel!” he would say. “Keep the road,&mdash;not
too far to the left. Well done! Here’s a level; now
trot a bit.”</p>

<p>So we went on,&mdash;sometimes up hill, sometimes down
hill,&mdash;for a long time, as it seemed. I began to grow chilly,
and even Lars handed me the reins, while he swung and
beat his arms to keep the blood in circulation. He no
longer sang little songs as when we first set out; but he was
not in the least alarmed, or even impatient. Whenever I
asked, as I did about every five minutes, “Are we nearly
there?” he always answered, “A little farther.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the wind seemed to increase.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said he, “now I know where we are; it’s one mile
more.” But one mile, you must remember, meant <i>seven</i>.</p>

<p>Lars checked the horse, and peered anxiously from side
to side in the darkness. I looked also, but could see nothing.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” I finally asked.</p>

<p>“We have got past the hills on the left,” he said. “The
country is open to the wind, and here the snow drifts worse
than anywhere else on the road. If there have been no
snow ploughs out to-night, we shall have trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p>You must know that the farmers along the road are obliged
to turn out with their horses and oxen, and plough down
the drifts, whenever the road is blocked up by a storm.</p>

<p>In less than a quarter of an hour we could see that the
horse was sinking in the deep snow. He plunged bravely
forward, but made scarcely any headway, and presently
became so exhausted that he stood quite still.</p>

<p>Lars and I stood up and looked around. In a few minutes
the horse started again, and with great labor carried us a
few yards farther.</p>

<p>“Shall we get out and try to find the road?” said I.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” Lars answered. “In these new drifts we
would sink to the waist. Wait a little, and we shall get
through this one.”</p>

<p>It was as he said. Another pull brought us through the
deep part of the drift, and we reached a place where the
snow was quite shallow. But it was not the hard, smooth
surface of the road; we could feel that the ground was uneven,
and covered with roots and bushes. Bidding Axel
stand still, Lars jumped out of the sled and began wading
around among the trees.</p>

<p>I shouted to him, in order to guide him, and it was not
long before he came back to the sled.</p>

<p>“If I knew where the road was,” said he, “I could get
into it again. But I don’t know, and I think we must stay
here all night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

<p>“We shall freeze to death in an hour!” I cried. I was
already chilled to the bone. The wind had made me very
drowsy, and I knew that if I slept, I should soon be frozen.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” exclaimed Lars, cheerfully. “I am a Norrlander,
and Norrlanders never freeze. I went with the men
to the bear hunt last winter, upon the mountains, and we
were several nights in the snow. Besides, I know what my
father did with a gentleman from Stockholm on this very
road, and we’ll do it to-night.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Let me take care of Axel first,” said Lars. “We can
spare him some hay and one reindeer skin.”</p>

<p>It was a slow and difficult task to unharness the horse, but
we accomplished it at last. Lars then led him under the
drooping branches of a fir-tree, tied him to one of them,
gave him an armful of hay, and fastened the reindeer skin
upon his back. Axel began to eat as if satisfied with the
arrangement.</p>

<p>When this was done, Lars spread the remaining hay evenly
over the bottom of the sled and covered it with the skins,
which he tucked in very firmly on the side towards the wind.
Then lifting them on the other side, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now take off your fur coat, quick, lay it over the hay,
and then creep under it.”</p>

<p>I obeyed as rapidly as possible. For an instant I shuddered
in the icy air; but the next moment I lay stretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
in the bottom of the sled, sheltered from the storm. I held
up the ends of the reindeer skins while Lars took off his coat
and crept in beside me. Then we drew the skins down and
pressed the hay against them. When the wind seemed to
be entirely excluded, Lars said that we must pull off our
boots, untie our scarfs, and loosen our clothes. When this
was done and we lay close together, I found that the chill
gradually passed out of my blood. My hands and feet were
no longer numb; a delightful feeling of comfort crept over
me, and I lay as snugly as in the best bed. I was surprised
to find that, although my head was covered, I did not feel
stifled. Enough air came in under the skins to prevent us
from feeling oppressed.</p>

<p>In five minutes, I think, we were sound asleep, and I
dreamed of gathering peaches on a warm August day at
home. In fact, I did not wake up thoroughly during the
night; neither did Lars, though it seemed to me that we
both talked in our sleep. I remember that his warm soft
hair pressed against my chin, and that his feet reached no
farther than my knees.</p>

<p>Just as I was beginning to feel a little cramped and stiff
from lying so still, I was suddenly aroused by the cold wind
on my face. Lars had risen up on his elbow, and was peeping
out from under the skins. “I think it must be near six
o’clock,” he said. “The sky is clear, and I can see the
big star. We can start in another hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<p>I felt so much refreshed that I was for setting out at once,
but Lars remarked, very sensibly, that it was not yet possible
to find the road. While we were talking, Axel neighed.</p>

<p>“There they are!” cried Lars, and he immediately began
to put on his boots, his scarf, and heavy coat. I did the
same, and by the time we were ready, we heard shouts and
the crack of whips. We harnessed Axel to the sled, and
proceeded slowly in the direction of the sounds, which came,
as we presently saw, from a company of farmers, out this
early to plough the road. They had six pairs of horses geared
to a wooden frame, something like the bow of a ship, pointed
in front and spreading out to a breadth of ten or twelve feet.
The machine not only cut through the drifts, but packed
the snow, leaving a good solid road behind it. After it had
passed, we sped along merrily in the cold morning twilight,
and in little more than an hour reached the posthouse at
Umea. There we found Lars’s father prepared to return
home. He waited until Lars had eaten a good warm breakfast,
when I said good-by to both, and went on towards
Lapland.</p>

<p>Lars was so quiet and cheerful and fearless, that although
I had been nearly all over the world and he had never been
away from home, I felt that I had learned a lesson from him,
and might probably learn many more, if I should know him
better.</p>

  <div class="verse indent2">Down a narrow pass they wandered,</div>

<h2><a id="THE_WHITE_SHIP"></a>THE WHITE SHIP</h2>


<p>Henry I, king of England, went over to Normandy with
his son Prince William and a great retinue to have the prince
acknowledged as his successor, and to contract a marriage
between him and the daughter of the Count of Anjou.
Both these things were triumphantly done, with great show
and rejoicing; and on the 25th of November, in the year
1120, the whole company prepared to embark for the voyage
home.</p>

<p>On that day, there came to the king, Fitz-Stephen, a
sea-captain and said, “My liege, my father served your
father all his life upon the sea. He steered the ship with the
golden boy upon the prow, in which your father sailed to
conquer England. I have a fair vessel in the harbor here,
called <i>The White Ship</i>, manned by fifty sailors of renown.
I pray you, Sire, to let your servant have the honor of steering
you in <i>The White Ship</i> to England.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, friend,” replied the king, “that my ship is
already chosen, and that I cannot, therefore, sail with the
son of the man who served my father. But the prince and
his company shall go along with you in the fair <i>White Ship</i>
manned by the fifty sailors of renown.” An hour or two
afterwards, the king set sail in the vessel he had chosen,
accompanied by other vessels, and, sailing all night with a
fair and gentle wind, arrived upon the coast of England in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
the morning. While it was yet night, the people in some of
these ships heard a faint, wild cry come over the sea, and
wondered what it was.</p>

<p>Now the prince was a dissolute young man of eighteen,
who bore no love to the English, and who had declared that
when he came to the throne, he would yoke them to the
plough like oxen. He went aboard <i>The White Ship</i> with
one hundred and forty youthful nobles like himself,
among whom were eighteen noble ladies of the highest
rank. All this gay company, with their servants and
the fifty sailors, made three hundred souls aboard the
fair <i>White Ship</i>.</p>

<p>“Give three casks of wine, Fitz-Stephen,” said the prince,
“to the fifty sailors of renown. My father the king has
sailed out of the harbor. What time is there to make merry
here, and yet reach England with the rest?”</p>

<p>“Prince,” said Fitz-Stephen, “before morning my fifty
and <i>The White Ship</i> shall overtake the swiftest vessel in
attendance on your father the king, if we sail at midnight.”
Then the prince commanded to make merry; and the
sailors drank the three casks of wine; and the prince and all
the noble company danced in the moonlight on the deck.</p>

<p>When, at last, the ship shot out of the harbor, there was
not a sober seaman on board. But the sails were all set,
and the oars all going merrily. Fitz-Stephen had the
helm. The gay young nobles and the beautiful ladies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
wrapped in mantles of various bright colors to protect them
from the cold, talked, laughed, and sang. The prince encouraged
the fifty sailors to row yet harder, for the honor of
<i>The White Ship</i>.</p>

<p>Crash! A terrific cry broke from three hundred hearts.
It was the cry the people, in the distant vessels of the king,
heard faintly on the water. <i>The White Ship</i> had struck
upon a rock,&mdash;was filling,&mdash;going down! Fitz-Stephen
hurried the prince into a boat with some few nobles. “Push
off,” he whispered, “and row to the land. It is not far
off, and the sea is smooth. The rest of us must die.” But
as they rowed fast away from the sinking ship, the prince
heard the voice of his sister calling for help. He never in
his life had been so noble as he was then. He cried in
agony, “Row back at any risk! I cannot bear to leave
her!”</p>

<p>They rowed back. As the prince held out his arms to catch
his sister, such numbers leaped into the boat that it was
overturned. And in the same instant, <i>The White Ship</i>
went down. Only two men floated. They both clung to
the main-yard of the ship, which had broken from the mast
and now supported them. One asked the other who he
was. He replied, “I am a nobleman,&mdash;Godfrey by name,
son of Gilbert. And you?”&mdash;”I am a poor butcher of
Rouen,” was the answer. Then they said together, “Lord
be merciful to us both!” and tried to encourage each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
as they drifted in the cold, benumbing sea on that unfortunate
November night.</p>

<p>By and by another man came swimming towards them,
whom they knew, when he pushed aside his long wet hair,
to be Fitz-Stephen. “Where is the prince?” said he.
“Gone, gone!” the two cried together. “Neither he, nor
his brother, nor his sister, nor the king’s niece, nor her
brother, nor any of all the brave three hundred, noble or
commoner, except us three, has risen above the water!”
Fitz-Stephen, with a ghastly face, cried, “Woe! woe to me!”
and sank to the bottom.</p>

<p>The other two clung to the yard for some hours. At
length the young noble said faintly, “I am exhausted, and
chilled with the cold, and can hold no longer. Farewell,
good friend! God preserve you!” So he dropped and sank;
and, of all the brilliant crowd, the poor butcher of Rouen
alone was saved. In the morning some fishermen saw him
floating in his sheepskin coat, and got him into their boat,&mdash;the
sole relater of the dismal tale.</p>

<p>For three days no one dared to carry the intelligence to
the king. At length they sent into his presence a little boy
who, weeping bitterly and falling at his feet, told him that
<i>The White Ship</i> was lost with all on board. The king fell
to the ground like a dead man, and never, never afterwards
was seen to smile.</p>

<h2><a id="A_BRIDGE_OF_MONKEYS"></a>A BRIDGE OF MONKEYS</h2>


<p>For many days we had been pushing our way, as best we
could, through one of the densest of South American forests.
Late one afternoon we stopped by the side of a narrow but
swiftly flowing river, and began to prepare our camp for the
night. Suddenly we heard, at some distance from us on the
other side of the stream, a great chattering and screaming,
as if thousands of monkeys were moving among the trees and
each trying to make more noise than all the rest.</p>

<p>“An army of monkeys on the march,” said our guide.
“They are coming this way, and will most likely cross the
river yonder where the banks are so steep, with those tall
trees growing on either side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>“How will they cross there?” I asked. “The water
runs so swiftly that they certainly cannot swim across.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the guide; “monkeys would rather go into
fire than water. If they cannot leap the stream, they will
bridge it.”</p>

<p>“Bridge it! and how will they do that?”</p>

<p>“Wait, captain, and you shall see,” answered the guide.</p>

<p>We could now plainly see the animals making their way
through the tree-tops and approaching the place which the
guide had pointed out. In front was an old gray-headed
monkey who directed all their movements and seemed to be
the general-in-chief of the army, while here and there were
other officers, each of whom appeared to have certain duties
to perform.</p>

<p>One ran out upon an overhanging branch, and, after looking
across the stream as if to measure the distance, scampered
back and made a report to the leader. There was at once a
change in the conduct of the army. Commands were given,
and a number of able-bodied monkeys were marched to the
front. Then several ran along the bank, examining the trees
on both sides.</p>

<p>At length all gathered near a tall cottonwood, that grew
over the narrowest part of the stream, and twenty or thirty
of them climbed its trunk. The foremost&mdash;a strong fellow&mdash;ran
out upon a limb, and, taking several turns of his
tail around it, slipped off, and hung head downwards. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
next on the limb climbed down the body of the first, and,
wrapping his tail tightly around him, dropped off in his turn,
and hung head downwards. And thus the third monkey
fastened himself to the second, and the fourth to the third,
and so on, until the last one upon the string rested his fore
paws upon the ground.</p>

<p>The living chain now commenced swinging back and forth
like a pendulum. The motion was slight at first, but
gradually increased, the monkey at the lower end striking
his hands against the ground and pushing out with all
his strength. This was kept up until the end of the chain
was thrown among the branches of the tree on the opposite
bank. One of these the lowermost monkey caught and held
fast. The chain now reached from one side of the stream
to the other, forming a living bridge over which all the other
monkeys, young and old, passed without confusion or delay.</p>

<p>The army was soon safely across, but how were the animals
forming the bridge to get themselves over? Should
the monkey at the top of the chain let go of the cottonwood
branch, the other end of the bridge was so much lower that
he, with those nearest him, would be dashed against the
opposite bank or soused into the water.</p>

<p>The question was soon answered. A powerful fellow was
seen taking firm hold of the lowest on the bridge, then another
fastened himself to him in like manner, and this was
continued until a dozen more were added to the string.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
These last monkeys then ran up to a high limb, and lifted
that end of the bridge until it was several feet above that on
the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Then the monkey who had formed the first link in the
chain loosed his hold upon the cottonwood branch, and the
whole bridge swung safely over. The lowermost links
dropped lightly to the ground, while the higher ones leaped
to the branches and came down by the trunk. The whole
army then scampered away into the forest, and the sound of
their chattering was soon lost in the distance.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_MIRROR"></a>THE MIRROR</h2>


<p>A long, long time ago there lived in a quiet spot a young
man and his wife. They had one child, a little daughter,
whom they both loved with all their hearts. I cannot tell
you their names, for they long since have been forgotten;
but the name of the place where they lived was Matsuyama,
in one of the provinces of Japan.</p>

<p>It happened once, while the little girl was still a baby,
that the father was obliged to go to the great city, the capital
of Japan, upon some business. It was too far for the
mother and her little one to go, and so he set out alone, after
promising to bring home some pretty presents for them.
The mother had never been farther from home than the
next village, and she could not help being very anxious at
the thought of the long journey her husband was about to
take. Yet she was proud, too, for he was the first man in
all that countryside who had been to the big town where the
king and his great lords lived, and where there were so
many beautiful and curious things to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p>At last the time came when she might expect her husband
to return; so she dressed the baby in her best clothes, and
herself put on an embroidered blue robe which she knew her
husband liked. You may fancy how glad she was to see
him home again, and how the little girl clapped her hands
and laughed with delight when she saw the pretty toys her
father had brought for her. He had much to tell of all
the wonderful things he had seen upon his long journey, and
in the great town which he had visited.</p>

<p>“I have brought you a very curious present,” said the
young man to his wife. “Look, and tell me what you see
inside of this.”</p>

<p>Then he gave her a plain, white wooden box, and when she
had opened it, she found a round piece of metal. One side
of the metal was white like frosted silver, and ornamented
with raised figures of birds and flowers; the other side was
bright as the clearest crystal. Into its shining surface the
young mother looked with wonder and delight, for there she
saw smiling at her, with parted lips and bright eyes, a happy,
joyous face.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” again asked the husband, pleased
at her astonishment, and glad to show that he had learned
something while he had been away.</p>

<p>“I see a pretty woman looking at me, and she moves her
lips as if she were speaking, and&mdash;how very odd, she has on
a blue dress like mine!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p>“Why, you silly woman, it is your own face that you see,”
said the husband, proud of knowing something that his wife
did not know. “That round piece of metal is called a mirror.
In the city everybody has a mirror, but in this country place
no one has ever before seen one.”</p>

<p>The wife was charmed with her present, and for a few days
could not look into the mirror often enough; for you must
remember that, as this was the first time she had seen a mirror,
so of course it was the first time she had ever seen the
reflection of her own fair face. But she considered such a
wonderful thing far too precious for everyday use, and soon
shut it up in its box again, and put it away carefully among
her most valued treasures.</p>

<p>Years passed on, and the husband and wife still lived
happily. The joy of their life was their little daughter,
who grew up the very image of her mother, and who was
so dutiful and affectionate that everybody loved her. Remembering
her own passing vanity on finding herself so
lovely in the mirror, the mother kept it carefully hidden
away, fearing that its use might breed a spirit of pride in her
little girl.</p>

<p>She never spoke of the mirror and the father had forgotten
all about it. So it happened that the daughter grew
up as simple as the mother had been, and knew nothing of
her own good looks, or of the mirror which would have reflected
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>But by and by a sad misfortune came upon this happy
little family. The good, kind mother became ill; and although
her daughter waited upon her day and night with
loving care, the sick woman grew worse and worse, until at
last they knew that she must soon die.</p>

<p>When she found that she must leave her husband and
child, the poor woman felt very sorrowful, grieving for those
she should see no more, and most of all for her little daughter.
She called the girl to her and said: “My darling child,
you know that I am very ill: soon I must die, and leave your
dear father and you alone. When I am gone, promise me
that you will look into this mirror every night and every
morning: there you shall see me and know that I am still
watching over you.”</p>

<p>With these words she took the mirror from the secret
place where it was kept, and gave it to her daughter. The
child promised, with many tears, to obey, and the mother,
having become calm and resigned, died within a short time.</p>

<p>Now the daughter never forgot her mother’s last request,
but each morning and evening took the mirror from its hiding
place and looked in it long and earnestly. There she
saw the bright and smiling vision of her lost mother; not
pale and sickly as she was in her last days, but young and
beautiful as in the days of long ago. To her mother at night
the young girl told the story of the trials and difficulties of
the day; and to her mother in the morning she looked for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
sympathy and encouragement in whatever might be in store
for her.</p>

<p>So day by day she lived as in her mother’s sight, striving
still to please her as she had always done, and careful always
to avoid whatever might pain or grieve her. The maiden’s
greatest joy was to be able to look into the mirror and say:
“Mother, I have been to-day what you would have me to
be.”</p>

<p>Seeing that his daughter looked into the mirror every night
and morning, and seemed to hold converse with it, her father
at length asked her the reason of her strange behavior.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said, “I look into the mirror every day to
see my dear mother and to talk with her.” Then she told
him of her mother’s dying wish, and that she had never
failed to fulfil it.</p>

<p>Touched by so much simplicity, and such faithful, loving
obedience, the father shed tears of pity and affection. Nor
could he find it in his heart to tell the child that the image she
saw in the mirror was but the reflection of her own sweet face
becoming day by day more and more like her dead mother’s.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_BLACK_DOUGLAS"></a>THE BLACK DOUGLAS</h2>


<p>King Edward I of England, commonly known as “Longshanks,”
nearly conquered Scotland. It was from no lack
of spirit or energy that he did not quite complete his troublesome
task, but he died a little too soon. On his death-bed
he called his pretty, spiritless son to him, and made him
promise to carry on the war; he then ordered that his
bones should be wrapped up in a bull’s hide, and carried at
the head of the army in future campaigns against the Scots.
Edward II soon forgot his promise to his father, and spent
his time in dissipation among his favorites, and allowed
the resolute Scots to recover Scotland.</p>

<p>Good James, Lord Douglas, was a very wise man in his
day. He may not have had long shanks, but he had a very
long head. He was one of the hardest foes with whom
the two Edwards had to contend, and his long head proved
quite too powerful for the second Edward, who, in his single
campaign against the Scots, lost at Bannockburn nearly all
that his father had gained.</p>

<p>The tall Scottish castle of Roxburgh stood near the border,
lifting its grim turrets above the Teviot and the Tweed.
When the Black Douglas, as Lord James was called, had
recovered castle after castle from the English, he desired to
gain this stronghold, and determined to accomplish his
wish. But he knew it could be taken only by surprise, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
a very wily affair it must be. He had outwitted the English
so many times that they were sharply on the lookout
for him.</p>

<p>Near the castle was a gloomy old forest, called Jedburgh.
Here, just as the first days of spring began to kindle in the
sunrise and the sunsets, and warm the frosty hills, the
Black Douglas concealed sixty picked men.</p>

<p>It was Shrove-tide, and the festival was to be celebrated
with song and harp and a great blaze of light, and free offerings
of wine in the great hall of the castle. The garrison
was to have leave for merrymaking and indulging in revelry.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down in the red sky, and the long, deep
shadows began to fall on the woods, the river, the hills, and
valleys. An officer’s wife had retired from the great hall,
where all was preparation for the merrymaking, to the
high battlements of the castle, in order to quiet her little
child and put it to rest. The sentinel, from time to time,
paced near her. She began to sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Hush ye, hush ye, little pet ye!</div>
  <div class="verse">Hush ye, hush ye, do not fret ye:</div>
  <div class="verse">The Black Douglas shall not get ye!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She saw some strange objects moving across the level ground
in the distance. They greatly puzzled her. They did not
travel quite like animals, but they seemed to have four legs.</p>

<p>“What are those queer-looking things yonder?” she
asked of the sentinel as he drew near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>“They are Farmer Asher’s cattle,” said the soldier,
straining his eyes to discern the outlines of the long figures
in the shadows. “The good man is making merry to-night,
and has forgotten to bring in his oxen; lucky ’twill be if they
do not fall a prey to the Black Douglas.”</p>

<p>So sure was he that the objects were cattle, that he ceased
to watch them longer. The woman’s eye, however, followed
the queer-looking cattle for some time, until they
seemed to disappear under the outer works of the castle.
Then feeling quite at ease, she thought she would sing again.
Spring was in the evening air; and, perhaps, it was the joyousness
of spring which made her sing.</p>

<p>Now, the name of the Black Douglas had become so terrible
to the English that it was used to frighten the children,
who, when they misbehaved, were told that the Black
Douglas would get them. The little ditty I have quoted
must have been very quieting to good children in those
alarming times.</p>

<p>So the good woman sang cheerily:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Hush ye, hush ye, little pet ye!</div>
  <div class="verse">Hush ye, hush ye, do not fret ye;</div>
  <div class="verse">The Black Douglas shall not get ye!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Do not be so sure of that,” said a husky voice close beside
her, and a mail-gloved hand fell solidly upon her
shoulder. She was dreadfully frightened, for she knew from
the appearance of the man he must be the Black Douglas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>The Scots came leaping over the walls. The garrison
was merrymaking below, and, almost before the disarmed
revellers had any warning, the Black Douglas was in the
midst of them. The old stronghold was taken, and many of
the garrison were put to the sword; but the Black Douglas
spared the woman and the child, who probably never afterwards
felt quite so sure about the little ditty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Hush ye, hush ye, do not fret ye;</div>
  <div class="verse">The Black Douglas shall not get ye!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Douglas had caused his picked men to approach the castle
by walking on their hands and knees, with long black cloaks
thrown over their bodies, and their ladders and weapons
concealed under their cloaks. The men thus presented
very nearly the appearance of a herd of cattle in the deep
shadows, and completely deceived the sentinel, who was
probably thinking more of the music and dancing below,
than of the watchful enemy who had been haunting the
gloomy woods of Jedburgh.</p>

<p>The Black Douglas fought with King Robert Bruce at
Bannockburn. One lovely June day, in the far-gone year
of 1329, King Robert lay dying. He called Douglas to his
bedside, and told him that it had been one of the dearest
wishes of his heart to go to the Holy Land, and recover
Jerusalem from the Infidels; but since he could not go, he
wished him to embalm his heart after his death, and carry
it to the Holy City, and deposit it in the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

<p>Douglas had the heart of Bruce embalmed and enclosed
in a silver case, and wore it on a silver chain about his neck.
He set out for Jerusalem, but resolved first to visit Spain and
engage in the war waged against the Moorish king of Granada.
He fell in Andalusia, in battle. Just before his death
he threw the silver casket into the thickest of the fight, exclaiming,
“Heart of Bruce, I follow thee or die!”</p>

<p>His dead body was found beside the casket, and the heart
of Bruce was brought back to Scotland and deposited in the
ivy-clad Abbey of Melrose.</p>

<p>Douglas was a real hero, and few things more engaging
than his exploits were ever told under the holly and mistletoe,
or in the warm Christmas light of the old Scottish Yule-logs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott.</span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_OLD_MAN_OF_THE_MEADOW"></a>THE OLD MAN OF THE MEADOW</h2>


<p>When I was a little girl, I caught a grasshopper and put
him into a bottle. Then I sat down outside the bottle, and
looked at the grasshopper. He sat inside the bottle, and
looked at me.</p>

<p>It began to grow upon my mind that the grasshopper
looked much like an old man. His face, with the big, solemn
eyes and straight mouth, was like an old man’s face. He
wore a gray coat, like a loose duster. He had a wrinkled
greenish vest. He wore knee-breeches and long red stockings.
The more I looked at him, the more he looked like a
little, grave, old-time man who came to visit my aged grandfather.
But I thought my grasshopper in the bottle felt
like a prisoner. I said, “Now you may go, my Old Man
of the Meadow.”</p>

<p>I took the cork out of the bottle. The grasshopper at
once leaped up, and sat on the rim of the bottle. Then a
strange thing happened. The Old Man of the Meadow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
spread out two wide brown wings. They had a broad,
lemon-colored band on them. They were gay as the wings
of a butterfly. On them he sailed away.</p>

<p>I could hardly believe my eyes. I ran after him to a tall
stalk of golden-rod. There he sat, a plain, gray-green old
man. But again he spread out the wide wings, and was
gone. My Old Man of the Meadow had then this splendid
dress-coat under his sober overcoat. Seated at rest, he
looked plain and quiet,&mdash;a creature of the earth. Lifted
into the air, he was nearly as fine as a butterfly.</p>

<p>The grasshopper lives much in the grass, and his chief
motion is in hops, or long jumps. He has another name,
“the murmurer.” This is given him because of the noise
or song he makes. His song is loud and shrill. It is made
by rubbing his wings one upon the other. He has a little
piece of skin like a tight drumhead set in each wing. As he
moves his wings, this tiny drum vibrates, or trembles, and
makes the shrill sound. Mrs. Grasshopper does not have
this drum in her wings.</p>

<p>Let us take a closer look at the grasshopper. As he is an
insect, he should have a body made in rings, in three parts,
with four wings and six legs set on the second, or chest part.
His front pair of legs is shorter than the others. This hinders
him in walking over a level surface. But it helps
him in walking up a tree, or small plant, or a wall. See
the hind legs! They are more than twice as long as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
others. The thigh, or upper part, is very long and strong.
By means of these big legs the grasshopper is a famous
jumper.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a grasshopper to look at, you will see
that the feet have four parts. The part of the leg between
the foot and the thigh has sharp points like the teeth of a
comb. The hind part of the body is long and slender, and,
being made of rings, can bend easily. In the great green
grasshopper all the body is of a fine green tint.</p>

<p>Let us look at the wings. The upper pair, or wing-covers,
are large and long. Notice two things about the wings:
they lap at the tips, and are high in the middle. When they
are shut, they have a shape like a slanting roof. The upper
ones are longer than the lower ones. These wing-cases have
large veins. Lift up a wing-case and pull out a lower wing.
It is folded very closely, in lengthwise plaits. Where these
wings join Mr. Grasshopper’s body, you will find his drum
plate for making music. One kind of grasshopper has very
short wing-covers. In that kind, both Mr. and Mrs. Grasshopper
make music. There is also one grasshopper, a little
green fellow, that has no drum, and is silent.</p>

<p>The upper side of the grasshopper’s chest is shaped like a
great horny collar. The head is large, and has two big
glossy eyes. There is, also, a knob on the forehead. Between
the eyes are set the feelers. They are very long, even
longer than all the body. The mouth of the grasshopper is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
wide, and it has strong jaws. But they are not so strong as
those of his cousin, the cricket.</p>

<p>Grasshoppers prefer vegetable food. They will sometimes
eat animal food. When two are shut up in a box,
they will fight, and the one which is killed will be eaten
by the victor.</p>

<p>If you could look inside the grasshopper’s body, you would
see that he has a gizzard much like that of a chicken. It is
made of little bands set with fine teeth. These teeth chew
up into a pulp the leaves which the grasshopper has eaten.
After he has eaten for a long time, he sits quite still. He
looks as if he were thinking. Sometimes, when he sits in
this way, he moves his mouth as if chewing. From this
action, people used to think that he chewed the cud, as cows
and sheep do. But he does not chew the cud. If you watch
him well, in these silent times, you will see him gravely
licking his long feelers and his lips. He seems to be cleaning
them. To do this, he runs out a long, limber tongue, shaped
much like yours.</p>

<p>The color in the grasshopper does not seem to be laid on
the surface of his coat, as on that of the beetle. It is not
put on in plumes and scales, as the butterfly has it. But
it is dyed through and through the wings and body. The
wing-cases and the rings of the body are not hard, like horn
or shell, as in the beetle tribe. They are of a tough skin,
and are dyed with the color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span></p>

<p>The grasshopper does not change its home. It dies near
where it was born. Frost and cold kill it. It does not outlive
the winter, as butterflies, bees, and wasps do. Each
grasshopper lives alone. He does nothing for his neighbor,
and his neighbor does nothing for him.</p>

<h2><a id="A_FOREST_FIRE"></a>A FOREST FIRE</h2>


<p>The day was sultry, and towards noon a strong wind
sprang up that roared in the pine tops like the dashing of
distant billows, but without in the least degree abating the
heat. The children were lying listlessly upon the floor, and
the girl and I were finishing sunbonnets, when Mary suddenly
exclaimed, “Bless us, mistress, what a smoke!”</p>

<p>I ran immediately to the door, but was not able to distinguish
ten yards before me. The swamp immediately
below us was on fire, and the heavy wind was driving a dense
black cloud of smoke directly towards us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p>“What can this mean?” I cried. “Who can have set
fire to the fallow?” As I ceased speaking, John Thomas
stood pale and trembling before me. “John, what is the
meaning of this fire?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ma’am, I hope you will forgive me; it was I set fire
to it, and I would give all I have in the world if I had not
done it.”</p>

<p>“What is the danger?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m afraid that we shall all be burnt up,” said John,
beginning to whimper. “What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Why, we must get out of it as fast as we can, and leave
the house to its fate.”</p>

<p>“We can’t get out,” said the man, in a low, hollow tone,
which seemed the concentration of fear; “I would have
got out of it if I could; but just step to the back door,
ma’am, and see.”</p>

<p>Behind, before, on every side, we were surrounded by a
wall of fire, burning furiously within a hundred yards of us,
and cutting off all possibility of retreat; for, could we have
found an opening through the burning heaps, we could not
have seen our way through the dense canopy of smoke, and,
buried as we were in the heart of the forest, no one could
discover our situation till we were beyond the reach
of help.</p>

<p>I closed the door, and went back to the parlor. Fear was
knocking loudly at my heart, for our utter helplessness de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>stroyed
all hope of our being able to effect our escape. The
girl sat upon the floor by the children, who, unconscious of
the peril that hung over them, had both fallen asleep. She
was silently weeping; while the boy who had caused the
mischief was crying aloud.</p>

<p>A strange calm succeeded my first alarm. I sat down
upon the step of the door, and watched the awful scene in
silence. The fire was raging in the cedar swamp immediately
below the ridge on which the house stood, and it presented a
spectacle truly appalling.</p>

<p>From out of the dense folds of a canopy of black smoke&mdash;the
blackest I ever saw&mdash;leaped up red forks of lurid flame
as high as the tree-tops, igniting the branches of a group of
tall pines that had been left for saw logs. A deep gloom
blotted out the heavens from our sight. The air was filled
with fiery particles, which floated even to the doorstep&mdash;while
the crackling and roaring of the flames might have
been heard at a great distance.</p>

<p>To reach the shore of the lake, we must pass through
the burning swamp, and not a bird could pass over it with
unscorched wings. The fierce wind drove the flames at
the sides and back of the house up the clearing; and
our passage to the road or to the forest, on the right and
left, was entirely obstructed by a sea of flames. Our only
ark of safety was the house, so long as it remained untouched
by the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<p>I turned to young Thomas, and asked him how long he
thought that would be. “When the fire clears this little
ridge in front, ma’am. The Lord have mercy on us then,
or we must all go.”</p>

<p>The heat soon became suffocating. We were parched
with thirst, and there was not a drop of water in
the house, and none to be procured nearer than the
lake. I turned once more to the door, hoping that a
passage might have been burnt through to the water.
I saw nothing but a dense cloud of fire and smoke&mdash;could
hear nothing but the crackling and roaring of
flames, which were gaining so fast upon us that I felt
their scorching breath in my face.</p>

<p>“Ah,” thought I&mdash;and it was a most bitter thought&mdash;”what
will my beloved husband say when he returns
and finds that his poor wife and his dear girls have
perished in this miserable manner? But God can save
us yet.”</p>

<p>The thought had scarcely found a voice in my heart
before the wind rose to a hurricane, scattering the flames on
all sides into a tempest of burning billows. I buried my
head in my apron, for I thought that all was lost, when a
most terrific crash of thunder burst over our heads, and,
like the breaking of a waterspout, down came the rushing
torrent of rain which had been pent up for so many
weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>In a few minutes the chip yard was all afloat, and the fire
effectually checked. The storm which, unnoticed by us,
had been gathering all day, and which was the only one of
any note we had that summer, continued to rage all night,
and before morning had quite subdued the cruel enemy
whose approach we had viewed with such dread.</p>

<h2><a id="ALADDIN"></a>ALADDIN</h2>


<p>One day, in one of the rich provinces of China, an African
magician stopped to watch some boys at play. Being a
magician, he knew that one of them was called Aladdin,
that his father was dead, that he and his mother lived alone,
and that he was a careless, idle fellow, just such a boy as
would be helpful to him, and one out of whom he could
make a tool.</p>

<p>The stranger, going up to Aladdin, touched him on the
shoulder, and said, “My lad, are you not the son of Mustapha,
the tailor?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the boy, “but my father has been dead
for some time.” On hearing this, the magician grieved
greatly, and, embracing Aladdin, said, “I am your father’s
brother; go tell your mother I shall come and sup with her
to-night.” He then gave a handful of money to the boy,
who hastened home to relate to his mother all that had
happened.</p>

<p>That night the stranger came. At the evening meal he
expressed great admiration for Aladdin, saying: “He must
be very like what his father was at his age; though it is
forty years since I left my native country, my love for my
brother has kept his features in my mind, and I recollected
them the moment I saw the boy.”</p>

<p>When he asked Aladdin what trade he had chosen, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
lad hung his head in shame at not being able to give an answer
to that question. His mother replied that he was a
worthless fellow, who cared only to loiter in the streets.
The magician reproved him for his idleness, and offered to
make a merchant of him, if he would but apply himself to
business. This Aladdin promised to do. His pretended
uncle provided him with fine clothing, and with many favors,
won the confidence of the boy and his mother.</p>

<p>One morning the magician set out with Aladdin to show
him something very wonderful. At length they came to
a valley which separated two mountains. Aladdin was
directed to gather dry sticks and kindle a fire. When this
was done, the magician, pronouncing certain magical words,
cast a perfume into the blaze. Immediately a great smoke
arose, the earth trembled and opened, showing a large, flat
stone. Then he said to the frightened boy, “There is hidden
under that stone an immense treasure, which you may
possess if you will carefully follow my instructions.” Aladdin
promised exact obedience. The magician then embraced
him, and putting a ring which would protect him from
danger upon his finger, bade him pronounce the names of
his father and his grandfather and raise the stone. Aladdin
obeyed, and discovered a hole several feet deep, and steps
to descend lower.</p>

<p>“Observe,” said the magician, “what I am about to tell
you. Not only the possession of the treasure, but your life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
itself depends on your careful attention. I have opened
the cave, but am forbidden to enter it. That honor is for
you alone. Go down boldly, then. At the bottom of the
steps you will find three great halls, but touch nothing in
them. At the end of the halls you will come to a garden;
at the farther end of it you will find a lamp, burning in a
niche. Take that lamp down, throw away the wick, pour
out the liquid, and put the lamp into your bosom to bring
to me.”</p>

<p>Aladdin secured the treasure and stopped to admire the
trees, which were loaded with fruits of many colors. He
knew nothing of the value of these fruits, but was so pleased
with their beauty that he filled his pockets. Then he returned
to the entrance and called to his uncle to assist him
in getting out.</p>

<p>Through his magic, the magician had learned that if he
could possess a lamp hidden somewhere underground, it
would make him more powerful than any prince in the
world, and he had resolved to have some friendless boy bring
him the wonderful talisman and then shut him up in the
cave. When Aladdin called for help, the magician refused
to assist him until he should give him the lamp, but this the
boy would not do until he was out of the cave. The dispute
lasted a long time, when the magician became so angry that
he pronounced two magical words, which replaced the stone
and closed the earth. By this means he lost all hope of ob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>taining
the lamp; it was forever out of his power to open
the cave again. He set off immediately for his own country.</p>

<p>In vain did the terrified boy call upon his uncle to let him
out. He was in great despair. In this state he continued
for two days, but on the third day, in distress, he happened
to clasp his hands together, and in doing so rubbed the
ring which the magician had put upon his finger, and in his
haste had forgotten to take away. Immediately an enormous
genie rose out of the earth, and said, “What wouldst
thou? I am ready to obey thee as thy slave whilst thou
wearest that ring, I and the other slaves of the ring.”
Aladdin answered, “I charge thee, by the ring, if thou art
able, to release me from this place.” He had no sooner
spoken than the earth opened and the genie lifted him up to
the surface, and immediately disappeared.</p>

<p>Aladdin hastened home and related all to his mother,
who was overjoyed to see him, but distressed that she had
no money with which to buy food for him. They agreed
to sell the lamp he had brought home, but to clean it first,
thinking if it were clean, it would bring a greater price. As
the mother began to rub it with sand and water, a genie of
gigantic size stood before her and said, “What wouldst
thou? I am ready to obey thee as thy slave, the slave
of all those who hold that lamp in their hands.”</p>

<p>The poor woman, overcome with fear, let the lamp fall,
but Aladdin caught it, and said, “I am hungry; bring me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
something to eat at once.” The genie disappeared and
returned with a large silver basin, containing twelve covered
plates of the same metal, all full of the choicest dainties.
When the provisions were all gone, Aladdin sold the plates
one by one for the support of himself and his mother.</p>

<p>One day Aladdin saw the beautiful daughter of the sultan.
He was so impressed with her beauty, that he requested
his mother to go to the sultan and to ask for him
the hand of the princess in marriage. The poor woman objected,
saying, “How can I go to the sultan with such a message?
What extravagant madness! Besides, no one approaches
the sovereign to ask a favor without a gift. What
have you to offer the sultan, even for his smallest favor,
much less for the highest he can bestow?”</p>

<p>“I own,” replied Aladdin, “my wishes are extravagant,
but you should not think I can send no gift to the sultan.
I am able to furnish you with one I am sure he will accept.”</p>

<p>Then Aladdin arranged the fruits he had brought from the
cavern, but which in reality were magnificent jewels, in a
vessel of fine porcelain, and persuaded his mother to carry
them to the monarch. “Depend upon it, my son,” she said,
“your present will be thrown away. The sultan will either
laugh at me, or be in so great a rage that he will make us
both the victims of his fury.”</p>

<p>The following day Aladdin’s mother appeared before the
sultan and with great fear made known her son’s desire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
The instant the sultan heard it, he burst into laughter, but
when he saw the marvellous jewels, his amusement gave
place to amazement. He said, “My good woman, return to
your son and tell him he shall marry the princess when he
sends to me forty basins of gold, each filled with the same
kind of stones, each basin to be carried by a black slave,
led by a young and handsome white slave, all handsomely
dressed.”</p>

<p>Full of disappointment the mother returned, but Aladdin
received her message with great pleasure. He rubbed his
wonderful lamp. The genie instantly appeared. Aladdin
told him of the sultan’s demand, and ordered him to provide
all that was required. In a very short time the house was
filled with the forty black slaves, each carrying a large
gold basin filled with precious stones, and covered with a
silver cloth embroidered in gold. Each black slave was led
by a white one. Aladdin requested his mother to take this
gift to the sultan.</p>

<p>All the passers-by stopped to gaze at the procession on
its way to the palace. The astonishment of the sultan himself
was great. He turned to Aladdin’s mother and said,
“Go, my good woman, tell your son I am waiting with open
arms to receive him.”</p>

<p>The joy with which Aladdin received the message Was
unutterable. When he arrived at court, the sultan came
from his throne to meet him, and ordered the marriage to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
take place at once. But Aladdin begged that he might
have time to build a palace for the charming princess, and
asked the sultan to select a suitable place for it.</p>

<p>“My son,” said the sultan, “take the large open space
before my palace; that may suit your purpose.”</p>

<p>Aladdin returned home, summoned the genie, and ordered
him to build a magnificent palace opposite that of the
sultan. The next morning at daybreak the genie appeared
and said, “Sir, your palace is finished; come, see if it is as
you desire.” The sultan was astonished; the princess
delighted. The marriage took place that day. For months
they lived in great happiness, and Aladdin won the love of
the people by his generosity.</p>

<p>About this time the wicked magician learned that Aladdin
had been very fortunate. He determined to destroy
him, and immediately set off for China. On his arrival, he
mingled with the people at the inns, and from them learned
that the prince had gone on a hunting expedition, and would
not return for several days.</p>

<p>His next step was to obtain the lamp. He bought a
dozen shining new ones, placed them in a basket, then went
to the palace, crying out, “Who will change old lamps for
new?” He drew a crowd of idle people about him, so that
the noise they made attracted the princess. One of the
women in waiting said, “Let us try if this man is as silly as
he pretends to be. There is an old copper lamp on a cornice;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
if the princess pleases, we shall see if he will give a new
one for the old.”</p>

<p>The princess consented, and the exchange was made.
Alas, poor princess! The magician had obtained the very
prize he sought. At midnight he rubbed the lamp. The
genie appeared, saying, “What wouldst thou? I am ready
to obey thee as thy slave, the slave of all those who possess
the lamp.” “I command thee,” said the magician, “to
transport the palace which thou hast built, and all who are
within, to a place in Africa.” The genie obeyed.</p>

<p>The next morning the grief and anger of the sultan were
terrible when he found that both his daughter and the
palace had disappeared. He blamed Aladdin. He exclaimed,
“Where is that impostor? Let his head pay the
price of his wickedness!”</p>

<p>Soldiers were sent in search of Aladdin, whom they met
on his return from hunting. He was dragged before the
sultan as a criminal and ordered to be instantly beheaded.
But the people of the province, who loved him very much,
burst into the palace, and so alarmed the sultan that he
ordered the executioner to set him at liberty.</p>

<p>Then Aladdin said, “Oh, sire, let me know my crime.”</p>

<p>“You should know where your palace stood. Look and
tell me what has become of it.”</p>

<p>Aladdin was overcome with grief and despair. This
angered the sultan still more, and he exclaimed, “Bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
back my daughter, whom I value a thousand times beyond
that palace; fail to do so, and nothing shall prevent me
from putting you to death.” Aladdin said: “Give me forty
days to search for my dear princess. If I am unsuccessful,
I shall return and deliver myself into your hands.”</p>

<p>“I give you forty days,” said the sultan.</p>

<p>Aladdin, wretched and downfallen, left the palace. As
he wandered by the bank of the river his foot slipped, and
catching hold of a piece of rock to save himself, he pressed
the magician’s ring that he wore on his finger. The genie
of the ring appeared, saying, “What wouldst thou have?”
Aladdin cried out, “Oh, genie, bring back my palace to
where it stood.” “I cannot do what you command,” replied
the genie; “you must ask the slave of the lamp.”
“At least,” begged Aladdin, “convey me to the place where
it now stands, and set me under the princess’s window.”
Instantly he found himself beside his palace.</p>

<p>The princess was walking in her chamber and weeping
for him. Happening to draw near the window, she saw
Aladdin, and at once sent one of her slaves to bring him into
the palace by a private gate. When the joy of their meeting
had subsided, the princess told him they were in Africa.
Then Aladdin knew it was the wicked magician who had
caused all his trouble, and he asked his wife what had become
of the old lamp he had left on the cornice of the hall. The
princess told him that her woman had exchanged it for a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
one, and that the tyrant in whose power she was, carried
that very lamp in his bosom, and that every day he paid her
a visit. They at last laid a plan by which they hoped to
regain possession of the talisman.</p>

<p>Aladdin went to the city in disguise as a slave; and
bought a powder which, if swallowed, would cause instant
death. In the evening the magician waited upon the princess,
who received him very graciously. After supper,
when the wine was placed before them, the princess gave a
signal to the servant, who placed a golden goblet before each
of them. In that of the princess was the powder Aladdin
had given her. Wine being poured, the princess told the
magician that in China it was customary to exchange cups,
and at the same time held her goblet out to him. He
eagerly made the exchange, and, drinking it all at one
draught, fell senseless on the floor.</p>

<p>When the magician fell, Aladdin, who had been watching,
ran to him, hastily snatched the lamp and rubbed it.
When the genie appeared, he commanded him to transport
the palace and all it contained to the place from which he
had brought it.</p>

<p>The sultan had continued to grieve for his daughter, and
every day went to his window to look at the spot where the
palace had stood. As usual, the morning after the return
of the palace, he went to the window, expecting to see the
spot still vacant, but, to his unspeakable joy, there he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
the glorious palace standing. He hastened to greet his
daughter and her husband, and he and Aladdin at once
forgave each other. The whole city rejoiced at the safe
return of their beloved prince and his princess. After the
death of the sultan, Aladdin and the princess ascended the
throne. They ruled wisely and well for many years, and
left noble sons and daughters to mourn their death.</p>

<h2><a id="LITTLE_DAFFYDOWNDILLY"></a>LITTLE DAFFYDOWNDILLY</h2>


<p>Daffydowndilly was so called because in his nature he
resembled a flower, and loved to do only what was beautiful
and agreeable, and took no delight in labor of any
kind. But while Daffydowndilly was yet a little boy, his
mother sent him away from his pleasant home, and put
him under the care of a very strict schoolmaster, who
went by the name of Mr. Toil. Those who knew him
best affirmed that this Mr. Toil was a very worthy character;
and that he had done more good, both to children
and grown people, than anybody else in the world.
Certainly he had lived long enough to do a great deal of
good; for, if all stories be true, he had dwelt upon earth
ever since Adam was driven from the garden of Eden.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Toil had a severe and ugly countenance,
especially for such little boys or big men as were
inclined to be idle; his voice, too, was harsh; and all his
ways and customs seemed very disagreeable to our friend
Daffydowndilly. The whole day long this terrible old
schoolmaster sat at his desk overlooking the scholars, or
stalked about the schoolroom with a certain awful birch-rod
in his hand. Now came a rap over the shoulders of
a boy whom Mr. Toil had caught at play, now he punished
a whole class who were behindhand with their lessons; and,
in short, unless a lad chose to attend quietly and con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>stantly
to his book, he had no chance of enjoying a quiet
moment in the schoolroom of Mr. Toil.</p>

<p>“This will never do for me,” thought Daffydowndilly.</p>

<p>Now the whole of Daffydowndilly’s life had hitherto
been passed with his dear mother, who had a much sweeter
face than old Mr. Toil, and who had always been very
indulgent to her little boy. No wonder, therefore, that
poor Daffydowndilly found it a woful change to be sent
away from the good lady’s side, and put under the care
of this ugly-visaged schoolmaster, who never gave him any
apples or cakes, and seemed to think that little boys were
created only to get lessons.</p>

<p>“I can’t bear it any longer,” said Daffydowndilly to
himself, when he had been at school about a week. “I’ll
run away and try to find my dear mother; and, at any
rate, I shall never find anybody half so disagreeable as
this old Mr. Toil!”</p>

<p>So, the very next morning, off started poor Daffydowndilly,
and began his rambles about the world, with only
some bread and cheese for his breakfast, and very little
pocket-money to pay his expenses. But he had gone
only a short distance when he overtook a man of grave
and sedate appearance, who was trudging at a moderate
pace along the road.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/p361.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Mr. Toil</span></div>
</div>

<p>“Good morning, my fine lad,” said the stranger; and
his voice seemed hard and severe, but yet had a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a><br /><a id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
kindness in it. “Whence do you come so early, and whither
are you going?”</p>

<div class="figleft" >
<img src="images/p362.jpg" alt="Little Daffydowndilly confessing" />
</div>


<p>Little Daffydowndilly had never been known to tell a lie
in all his life. Nor did he
tell one now. He hesitated
a moment or two, but finally
confessed that he had
run away from school, on
account of his great dislike
to Mr. Toil; and that he
was resolved to find some
place in the world where he
should never see or hear of
the old schoolmaster again.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, my little
friend!” answered the stranger.
“Then we shall go
together; for I, likewise,
have had a good deal to do with Mr. Toil, and should be
glad to find some place where he was never heard of.”</p>

<p>Our friend Daffydowndilly would have been better
pleased with a companion of his own age, with whom he
might have gathered flowers along the roadside, or have
chased butterflies, or have done many other things to
make the journey pleasant. But he had wisdom enough
to understand that he should get along through the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
much easier by having a man of experience to show him
the way. So he accepted the stranger’s proposal, and they
walked on very sociably together.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when the road passed by a field
where some haymakers were at work, mowing down the
tall grass, and spreading it out in the sun to dry. Daffydowndilly
was delighted with the sweet smell of the new-mown
grass, and thought how much pleasanter it must be
to make hay in the sunshine, under the blue sky, and with
the birds singing sweetly in the neighboring trees and
bushes, than to be shut up in a dismal schoolroom, learning
lessons all day long, and continually scolded by old Mr. Toil.
But, in the midst of these thoughts, while he was stopping
to peep over the stone wall he started back and caught hold
of his companion’s hand.</p>

<p>“Quick, quick!” cried he. “Let us run away, or he
will catch us!”</p>

<p>“Who will catch us?” asked the stranger.</p>

<p>“Mr. Toil, the old schoolmaster!” answered Daffydowndilly.
“Don’t you see him amongst the haymakers?”</p>

<p>And Daffydowndilly pointed to an elderly man, who
seemed to be the owner of the field, and the employer
of the men at work there. He had stripped off his coat
and waistcoat, and was busily at work in his shirt-sleeves.
The drops of sweat stood upon his brow; but he gave
himself not a moment’s rest, and kept crying out to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
haymakers to make hay while the sun shone. Now
strange to say, the figure and features of this old farmer
were precisely the same as those of old Mr. Toil, who, at
that very moment, must have been just entering his
schoolroom.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said the stranger. “This is not
Mr. Toil the schoolmaster, but a brother of his, who was
bred a farmer; and the people say he is the more disagreeable
man of the two. However, he won’t trouble you unless
you become a laborer on the farm.”</p>

<p>Little Daffydowndilly believed what his companion said,
but he was very glad, nevertheless, when they were out
of sight of the old farmer, who bore such a singular resemblance
to Mr. Toil. The two travellers had gone but little
farther, when they came to a spot where some carpenters
were erecting a house. Daffydowndilly begged his companion
to stop a moment; for it was a very pretty sight to
see how neatly the carpenters did their work, with their
broad-axes and saws, and planes, and hammers, shaping out
the doors, and putting in the window-sashes, and nailing
on the clapboards; and he could not help thinking that he
should like to take a broad-axe, a saw, a plane, and a hammer,
and build a little house for himself. And then, when
he should have a house of his own, old Mr. Toil would never
dare to molest him.</p>

<p>But, just while he was delighting himself with this idea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
little Daffydowndilly beheld something that made him
catch hold of his companion’s hand, all in a fright.</p>

<p>“Make haste. Quick, quick!” cried he. “There he is
again!”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked the stranger, very quietly.</p>

<p>“Old Mr. Toil,” said Daffydowndilly, trembling. “There!
He that is overseeing the carpenters. ’Tis my old schoolmaster,
as sure as I’m alive!”</p>

<p>The stranger cast his eyes where Daffydowndilly pointed
his finger; and he saw an elderly man, with a carpenter’s
rule and compass in his hand. This person went to and fro
about the unfinished house, measuring pieces of timber,
and marking out the work that was to be done, and continually
exhorting the other carpenters to be diligent. And
wherever he turned his hard and wrinkled visage, the men
seemed to feel that they had a task-master over them, and
sawed, and hammered, and planed, as if for dear life.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! this is not Mr. Toil the schoolmaster,” said
the stranger. “It is another brother of his, who follows the
trade of carpenter.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it,” quoth Daffydowndilly;
“but if you please, sir, I should like to get out of his way
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Then they went on a little farther, and soon heard the
sound of a drum and fife. Daffydowndilly pricked up his
ears at this, and besought his companion to hurry forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
that they might not miss seeing the soldiers. Accordingly
they made what haste they could, and soon met a company
of soldiers gayly dressed, with beautiful feathers in
their caps, and bright muskets on their shoulders. In
front marched two drummers and two fifers, beating on
their drums and playing on their fifes with might and
main, and making such lively music that little Daffydowndilly
would gladly have followed them to the end
of the world. And if he was only a soldier, then, he said
to himself, old Mr. Toil would never venture to look him
in the face.</p>

<p>“Quick step! Forward march!” shouted a gruff voice.</p>

<p>Little Daffydowndilly started, in great dismay; for this
voice which had spoken to the soldiers sounded precisely
the same as that which he had heard every day in
Mr. Toil’s schoolroom, out of Mr. Toil’s own mouth. And,
turning his eyes to the captain of the company, what should
he see but the very image of old Mr. Toil himself, with a
smart cap and feather on his head, a pair of gold epaulets
on his shoulders, a laced coat on his back, a purple sash
round his waist, and a long sword, instead of a birch-rod, in
his hand. And though he held his head so high, and strutted
like a turkey-cock, still he looked quite as ugly and disagreeable
as when he was hearing lessons in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>“This is certainly old Mr. Toil,” said Daffydowndilly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
in a trembling voice. “Let us run away, for fear he should
make us enlist in his company!”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken again, my little friend,” replied the
stranger very composedly. “This is not Mr. Toil the
schoolmaster, but a brother of his, who has served in the
army all his life. People say he’s a terribly severe fellow;
but you and I need not be afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said little Daffydowndilly, “but, if you
please, sir, I don’t want to see the soldiers any more.”</p>

<p>So the child and the stranger resumed their journey;
and, by and by, they came to a house by the roadside,
where a number of people were making merry. Young
men and rosy-cheeked girls, with smiles on their faces,
were dancing to the sound of a fiddle. It was the pleasantest
sight that Daffydowndilly had yet met with, and it
comforted him for all his disappointments.</p>

<p>“Oh, let us stop here,” cried he to his companion; “for
Mr. Toil will never dare to show his face where there is
a fiddler, and where people are dancing and making merry.
We shall be quite safe here!”</p>

<p>But these last words died away upon Daffydowndilly’s
tongue; for, happening to cast his eyes on the fiddler,
whom should he behold again but the likeness of Mr. Toil,
holding a fiddle-bow instead of a birch-rod, and flourishing
it with as much ease and dexterity as if he had been a fiddler
all his life! He had somewhat the air of a Frenchman, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
still looked exactly like the old schoolmaster; and Daffydowndilly
even fancied that he nodded and winked at him,
and made signs for him to join in the dance.</p>

<p>“Oh dear me!” whispered he, turning pale, “it seems
as if there was nobody but Mr. Toil in the world. Who
could have thought of his playing on a fiddle!”</p>

<p>“This is not your old schoolmaster,” observed the stranger,
“but another brother of his, who was bred in France, where
he learned the profession of a fiddler. He is ashamed of his
family, and generally calls himself Monsieur le Plaisir; but
his real name is Toil, and those who have known him best
think him still more disagreeable than his brothers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, take me back!&mdash;take me back!” cried poor
little Daffydowndilly, bursting into tears. “If there is
nothing but Toil all the world over, I may just as well
go back to the schoolhouse!”</p>

<p>“Yonder it is,&mdash;there is the schoolhouse!” said the
stranger; for though he and little Daffydowndilly had
taken a great many steps, they had travelled in a circle
instead of a straight line. “Come; we shall go back to
school together.”</p>

<p>There was something in his companion’s voice that
little Daffydowndilly now remembered, and it is strange
that he had not remembered it sooner. Looking up into
his face, behold! there again was the likeness of old Mr.
Toil; so that the poor child had been in company with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
Toil all day, even while he was doing his best to run away
from him. Some people are of opinion that old Mr. Toil
was a magician, and possessed the power of multiplying
himself into as many shapes as he saw fit.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, little Daffydowndilly had learned a
good lesson, and from that time forward was diligent at
his task, because he knew that diligence is not a whit more
toilsome than sport or idleness. And when he became
better acquainted with Mr. Toil, he began to think that
his ways were not so very disagreeable, and that the old
schoolmaster’s smile of approbation made his face almost as
pleasant as even that of Daffydowndilly’s mother.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_CLOCKS_OF_RONDAINE"></a>THE CLOCKS OF RONDAINE</h2>


<p>Centuries ago there stood on the banks of a river a little
town called Rondaine. The river was a long and winding
stream which ran through different countries. Sometimes
it was narrow and swift and sometimes broad and placid.
Sometimes it hurried through mountain passes and again it
meandered quietly through fertile plains. In some places
it was of a blue color and in others of a dark and sombre hue.
And so it changed until it threw itself into the warm, far-spreading
sea.</p>

<p>But it was otherwise with the little town. As far back
as anybody could remember, it had always been the same
that it was at the time of our story. And the people who
lived there could see no reason to suppose that it would ever
be different from what it was then. It was a pleasant little
town and its citizens were very happy. So why should
there be any change in it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p>If Rondaine had been famed for anything at all, it would
have been for the number of its clocks. It had many
churches, and in the steeple of each of these churches there
was a clock. There were town buildings which stood upon
the great central square. Each of these had a tower, and
in each tower was a clock. Then there were clocks at
street corners and in the market-place; clocks over shop
doors, and a clock at each end of the bridge.</p>

<p>Many of these clocks were fashioned in some quaint and
curious way. In one of the largest a stone man came out
and struck the hours with a stone hammer, while a stone
woman struck half hours with a stone broom; and in another
an iron donkey kicked the hours on a bell behind him. It
would be impossible to tell all the odd ways in which the
clocks of Rondaine struck.</p>

<p>It was very interesting to lie awake in the night and hear
the clocks strike. First would come a faint striking from
one of the churches in the by-streets, a modest sound; then
from another quarter would be heard a more confident
clock striking the hour clearly and distinctly. When they
were quite ready, but not a moment before, the seven bells
of the large church on the square would chime the hour.
The sound of these bells seemed to wake up the stone man
in the tower of the town building and he struck the hour
with his hammer. And when every sound had died away,
the iron donkey would kick out the hour on his bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

<p>The very last clock to strike in Rondaine was one belonging
to a little old lady with white hair, who lived in a little
white house in one of the prettiest and cleanest streets in
the town. Her clock was in a little white tower at the
corner of her house. Long after every other clock had
struck, the old lady’s clock would strike quickly and with a
tone that said, “I know that I am right, and I wish other
people to know it.”</p>

<p>In a small house which stood at a corner of two streets in
the town there lived a young girl named Arla. Her room
was at the top of the house, and one of its windows opened
to the west and another to the south. Arla liked to leave
these windows open so that the sound of the clocks might
come in. It was not because she wanted to know the hour
that she used to lie awake and listen to the clocks. She
could tell this from her own little clock in her room.</p>

<p>On the front of her clock, just below the dial, was a sprig
of a rosebush beautifully made of metal, and on this, just
after the hour had sounded, there was a large green bud. At
a quarter past the hour this bud opened a little, so that the
red petals could be seen; fifteen minutes later it was a half-blown
rose, and at a quarter of an hour more it was nearly
full blown. Just before the hour the rose opened to its
fullest extent, and so remained until the clock had finished
striking, when it immediately shut up into a great green bud.</p>

<p>This clock was a great delight to Arla; for not only was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
it a very pleasant thing to watch the unfolding of the rose,
but it was a satisfaction to think that her little clock always
told her exactly what time it was, no matter what the other
clocks of Rondaine might say.</p>

<p>Arla’s father and mother were thrifty, industrious people.
They were very fond of their daughter, and wished her to
grow up a thoughtful, useful woman. In the early morning,
listening to the clocks of Rondaine, Arla did a great
deal of thinking. It so happened on the morning of the
day before Christmas she began to think of something
which had never entered her mind before.</p>

<p>“How in the world,” she said to herself, “do the people
of Rondaine know when it is really Christmas? Christmas
begins at twelve o’clock on Christmas Eve; but as some of
the people depend on one clock and some upon others, a
great many of them cannot truly know when Christmas Day
has really begun. Not one of the clocks strikes at the right
time! As for that iron donkey, I believe he kicks whenever
he feels like it. And yet there are people who go by him!”
With these thoughts in her mind, Arla could not go to sleep
again. She heard all the clocks strike, and lay awake until
her own little clock told her that she ought to get up.</p>

<p>During this time she had made up her mind what she
should do. There was yet one day before Christmas, and
if the people of the town could be made to see in what a deplorable
condition they were, they might have time to set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
the matter right so that all the clocks should strike the correct
hour and everybody should know exactly when Christmas
Day began. Arla was sure that the citizens had never
given this matter proper thought.</p>

<p>When she went down to breakfast, she asked permission
of her mother to take a day’s holiday. Her mother was
quite willing to give her the day before Christmas in which
she could do as she pleased. So Arla started out gayly to
attend to the business she had in hand. Everybody in
Rondaine knew her father and mother and a great many of
them knew her, so there was no reason why she should be
afraid to go where she chose. In one hand she carried a
small covered basket in which she had placed her rose clock.</p>

<p>The first place she visited was the church where she and
her parents always attended service. When she entered
the dimly lighted church, Arla soon saw the sexton. He
was a pleasant-faced little man whom she knew very well.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” said she. “Do you take care of
the church clock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my little friend,” said he.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Arla, “I think you ought to know that
your clock is eleven minutes too fast. I came here to
tell you so that you might change it, and make it strike
properly.”</p>

<p>The sexton’s eyes began to twinkle. He was a man of
merry mood. “That is very good of you, little Arla; very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
good indeed. And now that we are about it, isn’t there
something else you would like to change? What do you
say to having these stone pillars put to one side, so that
they may be out of the way of the people when they come in?
Or what do you say to having our clock tower taken down
and set out there in the square before the church door?
Now tell me, shall we do these things together, wise little
friend?”</p>

<p>A tear or two came into Arla’s eyes and she went away.
“I suppose,” she said to herself, “that it would be too much
trouble to climb to the top of the tower to set the clock right.
But that was no reason why he should make fun of me. I
don’t like him as well as I used to.”</p>

<p>She now made her way to the great square of the town,
and entered the building at the top of which stood the stone
man with his hammer. She found the doorkeeper in a little
room by the side of the entrance. Arla thought she would
be careful how she spoke to him.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” she said with a courtesy, “I should
like to say something to you. And I hope you will not be
offended when I tell you that your clock is not right. Your
stone man and your stone woman are both too slow. They
sometimes strike as much as seven minutes after they ought
to strike.”</p>

<p>The grave, middle-aged man looked steadily at Arla
through his spectacles. “Child,” said he, “for one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
and fifty years the open tower on this building has stood
there. And through all these years, in storm and in fair
weather, by daylight or in the darkness of the night, that
stone man and that stone woman have struck the hours and
the half hours. And now you, a child, come to me and ask
me to change that which has not been changed in one hundred
and fifty years!”</p>

<p>Arla could answer nothing with those spectacles fixed upon
her.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” she said, as she turned and hurried
into the street. She walked on until she came to the house
of the little old lady with white hair. She concluded to
stop and speak to her about her clock. “She is surely willing
to alter that,” said Arla, “for it is so very much out of
the way.”</p>

<p>The old lady knew who Arla was and received her very
kindly; but when she heard why the young girl had come
to her, she flew into a passion. “Never since I was born,”
she said, “have I been spoken to like this! My great-grandfather
lived in this house before me; that clock was good
enough for him! My grandfather lived in this house before
me; that clock was good enough for him! My father and
mother lived in this house before me; that clock was good
enough for them! I was born in this house, have always
lived in it; that clock is good enough for me! I heard its
strokes when I was but a little child: I hope to hear them at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
my last hour; and sooner than raise my hand against the
clock of my ancestors, I would cut off that hand!”</p>

<p>Tears came into Arla’s eyes; she was a little frightened.
“I hope you will pardon me,” she said, “for truly I did not
wish to offend you. Nor did I think your clock is not a good
one. I only meant that you should make it better; it is
nearly an hour out of the way.”</p>

<p>The sight of Arla’s tears cooled the anger of the little old
lady. “Child,” she said, “you do not know what you are
talking about, and I forgive you. But remember this:
never ask persons as old as I am to alter the principles
which have always made clear to them what they should
do, or the clocks which have always told them when they
should do it.” And kissing Arla, she bade her good-by.</p>

<p>“Principles may last a great while without altering,”
thought Arla, as she went away, “but I am sure it is very
different with clocks.”</p>

<p>The poor girl now felt a good deal discouraged. “The
people do not seem to care whether their clocks are right or
not,” she said to herself.</p>

<p>Determined to make one more effort, Arla walked quickly
to the town building, at the top of which was the clock
with the iron donkey. This building was a sort of museum.
It had a great many curious things in it, and it was in
charge of an ingenious man who was very learned and
skilful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span></p>

<p>When Arla had told the superintendent why she had come
to him, he did not laugh at her nor did he get angry, but he
listened attentively to all that she had to say. “You must
know, Arla,” he said, “that our iron donkey not only kicks
out the hours, but five minutes before doing so he turns his
head around and looks at the bell behind him; and then,
when he has done kicking, he puts his head back into its
former position. All this action requires a great many
wheels and cogs and springs and levers. At noon on every
bright day I set the donkey right, being able to get the correct
time from a sundial which stands in the courtyard.
But his works&mdash;which I am sorry to say are not well made&mdash;are
sure to get a great deal out of the way before I set
him again. But so far as I know, every person but yourself
is perfectly satisfied with our donkey clock.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Arla, with a sigh; “but it is really
a great pity that every striking clock in Rondaine should
be wrong!”</p>

<p>“But how do you know they are all wrong?” asked the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is easy enough,” said Arla, “when I lie awake
in the early morning, I listen to their striking, and then I
look at my own rose clock to see what time it really is.”</p>

<p>“Your rose clock?” said the superintendent.</p>

<p>“This is it,” said Arla, opening her basket and taking out
her little clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

<p>The superintendent took it into his hands and looked at
it, outside and inside. And then, still holding it, he stepped
out into the courtyard. When in a few moments he returned,
he said, “I have compared your clock with my sundial,
and find that it is ten minutes slow!”</p>

<p>“My&mdash;clock&mdash;ten&mdash;minutes&mdash;slow!” exclaimed Arla,
with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the superintendent. “Such a clock as this&mdash;which
is a very ingenious and beautiful one&mdash;ought frequently
to be compared with a sundial, and set to the proper
hour.”</p>

<p>Arla sat quiet for a moment and then she said: “I think
I shall not care any more to compare the clocks of Rondaine
with my little rose clock. If the people do not care to know
exactly when Christmas Day begins, I can do nobody any
good by listening to the different strikings and then looking
at my own little clock.”</p>

<p>“Especially,” said the superintendent, with a smile,
“when you are not sure that your rose clock is right. But
if you bring your little clock and your key here on any day
when the sun is shining, I shall set it to the time shadowed
on the sundial, or show you how to do it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Arla, and she took her leave.</p>

<p>As she walked home she lifted the lid of the basket and
looked at her little rose clock. “To think of it!” she said,
“that you should be sometimes too fast and sometimes too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
slow! And worse than that, to think that some of the
other clocks have been right and you have been wrong.
I can hardly believe it of you.”</p>

<p>But the little clock never went to be compared with the
sundial. “Perhaps you are right now,” Arla would say to
her clock each day when the sun shone, “and I shall not take
you until some time when I feel very sure that you are
wrong.”</p>

<p>Whether it was right or wrong Arla was satisfied that no
other clock in Rondaine was its equal. But she kept her
thoughts to herself, and never again attempted to regulate
the affairs of others.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frank R. Stockton.</span></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
